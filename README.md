Framing Bias: How Labeling Choices Shape Media Bias Detection in LLMs
We fine-tuned three instances of the Mistral-7B language model using real news headlines labeled with political bias. Each model was trained under a different framing condition (left, right, and neutral) to illustrate how bias framing influences model output. The labels were sourced from a media bias API and applied to articles scraped from the media homepages. Then, each model was evaluated on the same set of headlines to observe how framing impacts predictions.

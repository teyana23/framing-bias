ilrc.org,left,IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER,"The Trump administration has ordered the prioritization of federal prosecutions for immigration-related offenses, including for simply entering the United States or reentering after removal without permission. Congress is considering budget proposals with hundreds of billions of dollars for border and immigration enforcement, including billions that would fund a dramatic increase in federal criminal prosecutions for immigration offenses. At the same time, some in Congress are again proposing legislation that would fuel mass incarceration by increasing penalties for those charged criminally for unauthorized reentry into the United States. This explainer describes how the budget proposals currently in Congress would fund mass prosecutions that have already had a deadly and costly impact over the years. It also explains how the proposed legislation would line the pockets of the private prison industry with enormous cost to taxpayers.",https://ilrc.org,homepage_scrape

countervortex.org,left,CounterVortex,"The shock attack from the Gaza Strip has terrified Israelis, and the government appears to be preparing a massive retaliation. But writing for Israel’s independent +972 Magazine, Haggai Matar insists that the current horror must bring home the overwhelming context. Contrary to what many Israelis are saying, this is not a “unilateral” or “unprovoked” attack. The dread Israelis feel now is a sliver of what Palestinians have experienced daily under the decades-long military regime in the West Bank, the siege and repeated assaults on Gaza. In recent months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been marching for “democracy and equality” across the country, with many even saying they would refuse military service because of this government’s authoritarian turn. What those protestors and reserve soldiers need to understand—especially now, as many of them announce they will halt their protests to join the new war on Gaza—is that Palestinians have been struggling for those same demands for decades, facing an Israel that to them is already, and has always been, completely authoritarian.

Each of these methodologies has unique strengths. Each of these methodologies has unique limitations. Way too often, prospective clients come to SurveyUSA asking for a price-quote for a specific methodology. Metaphorically, it’s like being a physician and having a patient approach you and ask … “What would you charge to attach leeches to me and have them suck my blood?” Who would you rather have as your research partner? A junior account exec who looks at the laminated card she was handed at the last company offsite and says, “That will be $183.49 per leech” … or a principal in a research firm who says, “Forgive me, but can we talk about why you think that leeches are the right approach in today’s world?” To extend the metaphor, SurveyUSA often hears back, “Well, we’ve always used leeches in this kind of a situation, and it’s important for us not to introduce a new variable into the equation.” SurveyUSA gets an “F” grade at holding our tongue. We lose business when we level with our prospective clients and say, “We think there may be a better approach than the one you are recommending.” That, we feel, is our obligation: to tell prospective clients what realistically is possible given your unique circumstances, your particular budget, and the realities of conducting research in an 8-second attention-span world. That is why SurveyUSA does not offer on our website a shopping cart where you click to order and click to pay. With opinion research, every job is custom; we choose not to pretend to warehouse our “best-sellers” in digital inventory. Just as one would not use a soup spoon to paddle a canoe nor a butter knife to shovel snow, SurveyUSA will match you with the tool best suited to your project. Let us level with you. That’s a key part of The SurveyUSA Way.

If you liked the original blog you can expect more of the same Mammothy goodness, as we take apart everyone from incels to dating coaches.

electoral-vote.com,left,Electoral-vote.com,"Reader M.L. in Athens, OH, wrote in to tell us that the scandal name that the Internet has settled on for the Signal scandal is ""Whiskeyleaks."" That's pretty good, so we're going with it. The time will come when this story fades away, likely replaced by some other outrage from the Trump administration. But that time has not come yet, and so Whiskeyleaks continues to dominate the headlines. Most notably, in a pretty clear sign that the White House will not be completely free of this headache for a very long time, Judge James Boasberg, the same guy who is dealing with the Venezuelan deportations, has ordered the administration to preserve all the messages exchanged by the Group of 18. On one hand, these folks are more than happy to look this exact Judge in the face and lie, claiming they were unable to do what he ordered. On the other hand, the key portion of the messages is already public (and who knows if Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg has more that he hasn't released). So, in this case, defiance and a risk of contempt of court might not be worth it. Meanwhile, now that this is the scandal du jour, everyone is looking everywhere for additional angles to explore. And yesterday, enterprising journalists found at least two such angles. First, Willamette Week, a publication you've probably never heard of unless you live somewhere between Portland, OR, and Eugene, OR, noticed that one of the people who were on the text chain was Director of the National Counterterrorism Center-designate Joe Kent. Note the ""designate"" part of that. People who have not actually been confirmed by the Senate are not legally allowed to be seeing conversations like this until they are official. Or, until they are official officials, if you prefer. The second bit of reporting comes from Spiegel International, which might be familiar to more readers, as it is the international arm of Der Spiegel, which is Germany's largest newsmagazine. It would seem that several key members of the text chain are not only careless about data security, they are downright incompetent in that particular area. The German reporters were able to find, via publicly available webpages and databases, cell phone numbers, personal e-mail addresses, and passwords that were used by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. It is not known if any of the information is still current, but it's recent enough that some of it (or all of it) certainly could be. If a person is not clever enough to keep their cell phone number private, then they are certainly not clever enough to develop their own security protocols in place of those developed by the pros who work for the federal government. Undoubtedly, many Americans, and most readers of this site, would like to see the behavior on display, which was both reckless and unlawful, be punished. It is somewhat improbable that any legal wrangling, whether in the court of Boasberg or other judges, will produce anything more than embarrassment for the administration. After all, if there were going to be any criminal charges, they would have to come from AG Pam Bondi and her underlings. Don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen. On the other hand, there is clearly a PR problem here. YouGov won the race to be the first outfit to poll Whiskeyleaks, and they found that 74% of respondents, and 60% of Republicans, think this breach is serious, or very serious. The favorability ratings of both Waltz and Hegseth are in the toilet (high 20s/low 30s), and Trump himself has gone from being a bit above water a couple of weeks ago (48% approve, 46% disapprove in the RCP aggregate) to being underwater again (47% approve, 48.8% disapprove). And the story does not appear to be running out of steam. Trump clearly does not want to fire anyone, because doing so is tantamount to admitting a mistake, and he doesn't like to do that. On the other hand, if a price needs to be paid, somebody needs to pay it, and it isn't going to be Trump himself. Yesterday, after days of defending Waltz, the President said that while he still supports his NSA, he also blames Waltz for what happened: ""I always thought it was Mike."" That is the first baby step toward lopping Waltz's head off. At the moment, there is reportedly a serious effort in the West Wing to convince Trump to push Waltz out the door. And the big problem that Waltz has, beyond having caused this scandal with his carelessness, is that Goldberg's number was on his phone. Trump loathes Goldberg, as he was the one who first wrote the story about Trump calling America's war dead ""suckers"" and ""losers."" Waltz needs to come up with an explanation for why he had Goldberg's number, and how it was accessible enough that it could be accidentally added to the text chain. Thus far, all the NSA has come up with is that it must have been one of his staff who was responsible. Uh, huh. If Trump becomes fixated on the PR damage here, and on the ""betrayal"" involved in having Goldberg's number, Waltz really could be in trouble here. It would probably help seal the deal if the folks lobbying Trump were to observe that if Waltz managed to screw up this badly in just 2 months on the job, he's sure to do it again if he remains a part of the administration. (Z) Remember how Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) was imminently going to become U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Elise Stefanik? After all, she was nominated and given the thumbs-up by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Under those conditions, even Jack the Ripper would have all 53 Republican votes in the Senate when it came time for final confirmation. Well, yesterday, it all came crashing down for the Representative, as Donald Trump pulled the nomination. This is, of course, a huge blow to Stefanik's previously upward trajectory. She really wanted this gig because it would have increased her profile and would have given her some claim to foreign policy experience. The next rung on the ladder was presumably a Cabinet position in the next Republican administration (or in the latter years of the current Republican administration), and then a presidential run. Now, the plan is in shambles. Further, because Stefanik was expecting to leave the House, she gave up her position in leadership, succeeded as the No. 4 Republican by Lisa McClain (R-MI). McClain is not going to resign as a gift to Stefanik, and the House Republican Conference is not going to vote to fire McClain and replace her with Stefanik, either. So, the would-be ambassador just became a backbencher again. Whether she can resume climbing up the ladder is an excellent question, especially since she stepped on some toes in the past few months. Once Stefanik learned which way the winds were blowing, she desperately tried to convince Trump to change his mind, reminding him of how loyal she's been to him and to MAGAism. But, as always, loyalty is a one-way street with Trump. Throwing Stefanik (and, very possibly, her career) under the bus served his needs, and so that is what happened, her needs be damned. So, how did this serve his needs? There are almost certainly three answers to that question, which happen to exist in something of a chronological relationship to each other. The short-term concern is the special elections in Florida next week. We have pointed out some of the signs that Randy Fine (R) might just be in trouble in FL-06, despite the district being ruby red, and now there's an actual poll that backs that up. It's from St. Pete Polls, which isn't a great pollster, and which was only able to put together a fairly small sample of FL-06 voters. Still, an ""only OK"" poll is better than no poll. And St. Pete Polls found that 48% of voters back Fine, while 44% back his Democratic opponent Josh Weil. That's well within the margin of error, which is 4.9% because of the small sample size. You would still have to wager on Fine to hold on, but even if he wins a fairly close one, that's still pretty bad news for the administration. This brings us to the second purpose served by this change of course. As we have written a hundred times, the Republicans' margin of error in the House is tiny. It gets even tinier if Stefanik leaves, of course, and at a time that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is trying to move some very tough legislation. And making things worse is that if Republican members see the results on Tuesday, and conclude (quite reasonably) that voters are punishing Trumpism, they will be more likely to break ranks. If Susan Crawford wallops Brad Schimel in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election Tuesday, it would have the same effect. It only takes a few purple-district GOPers to throw a giant wrench into the works. So, Trump needs as much insurance as he can muster up. And, finally, there is the third reason that Stefanik needed to stay put. The Republicans just lost an R+15 state senate district in Pennsylvania. They look to be facing a nailbiter (and a possible loss) in FL-06, which is also R+15. Stefanik's district, NY-21, is R+8. In an environment where even an R+15 seat isn't safe, an R+8 seat REALLY isn't safe. If Stefanik gives her seat up, there's no guarantee that the Republicans get it back. Currently, the House is 218R, 213D. Now imagine this not-impossible scenario: (1) the two special elections in Florida next week go 1R, 1D; (2) the Democrats hold the D+15 and D+23 seats currently vacant due to the deaths of Democratic members; and (3) Stefanik vacates her seat and it flips to the Democrats. If this is what came to pass, then the House would be 218R, 217D. Not only would every single Republican have a veto, but if one Republican dies, or gets caught breaking the law, or decides to quit for some other job, then you have an evenly split House, and a power-sharing arrangement. This possibility, while not likely, is realistic enough that Trump and Johnson could not countenance it. So, under the bus goes Stefanik, who becomes the latest person to learn the true cost of making a deal with the devil. (Z) Long-term, the efforts by Co-Presidents Elon Musk and Donald Trump to terminate hundreds of thousands of federal workers will not stand up to legal scrutiny. The Pendleton Act is a real thing, collectively bargained contracts are a real thing, and Musk's claim to power is NOT a real thing. But, in the end, their ""plan"" surely isn't to win the lawsuits. It's to do the same thing Trump has done a million times before: use the courts to make it so onerous to fight back that people throw in the towel. Even if a bunch of judges, months or years from now, order every terminated employee to be reinstated, Musk and Trump still win if 50,000 of them or 100,000 of them or 200,000 of them have moved on to new employment, and aren't interested in once again putting their future in the hands of an unreliable employer. We write this as prelude to two more stories yesterday about the Trump administration trying to cut the legs out from under federal workers. The first is that, under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a person who earned everything he has in life and undoubtedly never benefited from things like familial wealth or a famous name, HHS plans to dramatically overhaul its organization chart, and to eliminate 10,000 employees. This will not only leave those folks (and anyone else who depends on their salaries) high and dry, it will also mean that the services rendered by HHS will be less accessible, or inaccessible. It's like Kennedy is determined to make sure that Trump averages one major pandemic per presidency. It is not a secret to anyone who works for the federal government (or anyone who works at a university for that matter) that large-scale organizations suffer from administrative bloat over time. So, there is some value in a careful pruning of the workforce, from time to time. But if this was a serious effort to reform HHS, it would be handled in accordance with existing law and policy, would be implemented in phases over the course of several years, and would likely involve (mostly) leaving posts unfilled when they are vacated by retirement or resignation. These kinds of mass firings speak to a desire for PR, and a desire to undercut the agency, not a desire to engage in serious reform. The second story, meanwhile, is that Trump issued an executive order yesterday in which he decreed that federal workers can no longer unionize, and that the government will no longer participate in collective bargaining. His basis for this is a reading of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 that is... novel, shall we say. So novel that even the notoriously anti-union Ronald Reagan would never have tried it. Essentially, the law says that employees cannot interfere with the basic functions of government (for example, Secret Service officers could not go on strike and leave the president unprotected in an effort to create leverage). Whoever is creating fairy-tale law for Trump decided that any union activity whatsoever—organizing, collective bargaining, striking—automatically interferes with the basic functions of government, so all of it is a violation of the Civil Service Reform Act. It's creative, we'll give them that. With the HHS reorganization, the administration can at least argue it's about efficiency and saving money, even if such claims do not stand up to scrutiny. The new XO, by contrast, is a baldfaced attempt to weaken federal employees and, more broadly, unions. Undercutting unions, in particular, has been a part of the Republican political project at least as far back as The Gipper. One wonders if all those union workers who voted for Trump, like Teamsters leader Sean O'Brien, will eventually take notice. (Z) There were also a trio of news stories yesterday on the abortion front. First up, out of that bastion of freedom that is Texas, AG Ken Paxton is trying very hard to punish Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based OB/GYN who allegedly provided abortifacient pills to a woman in Texas. It is true that this is a violation of Texas state law, which establishes penalties for out-of-state doctors in this situation. It is also true that Paxton went to law school (the University of Virginia, to be exact), and surely learned that Texas state law stops at the Texas border. It is further true that Paxton cares nothing about the law, and is only interested in showboating, either in search of glory, or in hopes of running for higher office. So, under these circumstances, Paxton filed suit in Texas state court, and he got a judgment against Carpenter for $113,000. Then, he sent the order to New York, requesting that authorities there enforce the order. That's a problem, not only because New York is generally uninterested in taking marching orders from some other state, but also because state law has specifically been amended to forbid state officials from complying with laws like the one in Texas. So yesterday, acting Ulster county clerk Taylor Bruck told Paxton to shove his court order where the Lone Star don't shine. The AG will try to get this matter before the U.S. Supreme Court, but it's fair to wonder if they will grant cert. And even if they do, we would guess the justices, even the conservative ones, will be very leery to declare that states are allowed to pass laws governing the behavior of people in other states. Not only is that clearly unconstitutional, but Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito can figure out what a state like California might do with that power, even if Ken Paxton can't. The other pair of stories are both out of Georgia. The Peach State has some of the worst maternal mortality rates in the nation. And, it would seem, the Republican-controlled legislature wants to make things even worse. So, they are considering a near-total abortion ban, very much along the lines of the ones in other Deep South states. Should the measure become law, an abortion would become illegal as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detectable. That would work out to a cutoff of about 6 weeks, which is before most women know they are pregnant. The only exception to the law would be if the life of the mother was in danger. While that might sound reasonable in theory, in practice it creates a lot of danger for mothers, and no small number of injuries and deaths, because medical professionals are leery of intervening until doing so is absolutely, 100%, no-question-about-it justified. By then, it's often too late. The other Georgia story speaks to the... culture, for lack of a better word, that has already trickled down to at least some of the folks responsible for enforcing the state's current, still pretty restrictive, abortion laws. A 24-year-old woman, whose name is publicly known but does not need to be repeated here, suffered a spontaneous miscarriage. It was so spontaneous, in fact, and so traumatic that she passed out, bleeding, outside her residence. Before she passed out, fearing prosecution, she tried to dispose of the fetus. This did not work; she was arrested by Georgia state police and charged with ""concealing the death of another person"" and ""abandonment of a dead body."" That was last week. Since then, the coroner's office in Tift County has conducted a full autopsy on the miscarried 19-week-old fetus. The finding was that there was no trauma, no evidence that the woman tried to abort the pregnancy, and that the fetus was dead while still in her body and never took a breath. And so, Georgia law enforcement has responded by... keeping the woman in jail. They are still deciding whether or not to drop the charges. We recognize that our headline (""War on Women"") is pretty loaded. We are very familiar with the arguments and the rhetoric of the anti-choice movement, as we have been paying close attention to those folks for decades. Consistently, the great majority of anti-choice activists have said: (1) abortion is a states' rights issue, and (2) of course the procedure should be available in cases of rape, incest, or the mother's health is in danger. Neither of those two precepts is being followed in the cases covered by the above news stories. Meanwhile, we have never once heard an anti-choice advocate say that if a woman suffers a miscarriage, and there is even the slightest chance it might not be a ""real"" miscarriage, she should be imprisoned and made to suffer during a period of intense physical and emotional trauma. And yet, that is exactly what is happening in the third story. Maybe the rhetoric of the anti-choice movement wasn't truthful. Maybe the people in positions of power, like Ken Paxton, don't actually care what the movement wants and are taking matters into their own hands, in service of their own goals. We do not feel particularly qualified to judge what is going on. What we do know is that if the United States chucks 10,000 bombs in the direction of Yemen, it is making war on Yemen, no matter what the U.S. government's stated (or actual) goals might be. Similarly, you have abortion policies that are turning women physicians into criminals, that are leading women in Georgia and elsewhere to be maimed or killed, and that are putting the 25% of women who suffer a miscarriage at real risk of being imprisoned. Regardless of what the stated (or actual) intent is, that is a war on women. (Z) Politicians can get away with an awful lot, especially these days. However, one thing that is tough to overcome is if some sort of bad behavior is captured on tape. If people can hear it for themselves, it's rather harder to make the problem go away. Even worse than that is if the bad behavior is captured on video. As it turns out, people trust their own eyes, quite a bit. We make this observation because the Trump administration has a couple of video problems right now, both of them related to the scapegoating of those who are foreign-born. The first of those involves DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who seems to have some of the worst political instincts ever seen from a politician of (nominally) national stature. Yes, she managed to twice get herself elected as governor of South Dakota, but maybe securing the leadership of a state with 900,000 or so people is not quite the same crucible of fire as running for, say, U.S. Senator from New York. Anyhow, despite the fact that the Trump administration has yet to offer any proof that the people deported to El Salvador were actually gang members, and despite the fact that the administration's actions have already been deemed to be in violation of the law by James Boasberg, Noem and Donald Trump are still trying to squeeze this for all it's worth. And so, she traveled to El Salvador with a press contingent, so that she could be filmed railing against immigrants with the deported, and now imprisoned, Venezuelans in the background of the shot: She posted the video, filmed on an iPhone, to her eX-Twitter account within a few minutes of it being recorded. Clearly, she was eagerly awaiting a pat on the head from the Dear Leader. We fully understand that the point here is to look ""strong."" But just like the dog-shooting story, it actually makes Noem look cruel and inhuman. Again, there has yet to be any proof that these men are guilty of anything (and there has now been reporting that the main ""evidence"" of their guilt was... that they have tattoos). And even if they are guilty of a crime, or many crimes, cramming them into a small space, with shaved heads, and then using them as a backdrop is really icky. Especially since they were clearly posed by the jailers, as The Bulwark's Jonathan Last points out. And not only is it icky, it's potentially illegal. The Trump administration has a bad habit of using one interpretation of events when it suits their needs, and then switching to a radically different one as necessary. For example, the Signal messages were alternately ""classified"" and ""not classified"" depending on what particular characterization was most useful at the time. Similarly, the forced deportations of these men were justified on the basis that they were ""making war"" on the United States, and so the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 is in effect. Well, if so, the Geneva Conventions forbid the use of prisoners of war as props for political messaging (or for any other purpose). Moving along, the other video is the one that might really catch fire. The next 48 hours or so will tell the tale. The administration continues to target graduate students who are Muslim, based on increasingly spurious claims that they somehow have something to do with Palestine or Hamas. Yesterday, for example, the feds arrested Iranian national Alireza Doroudi, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering. Exactly what he did to cause this is unknown, as the government has refused to comment since ""disappearing"" him to... Louisiana... maybe? Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the visas of 300 other grad students have been revoked. So, what exactly is this video we keep talking about? Well, it actually involves yet another grad student, a hijab-wearing Turkish woman named Rumeysa Ozturk, who is enrolled at Tufts University in Boston. The Trump administration has done us all the kindness of at least semi-explaining itself in this case, saying that Ozturk is guilty of ""glorifying and supporting terrorists"" and that she has shown support for Hamas. Exactly what that means, however, is not clear. It's not too hard to discover that she was one of four authors on a pro-Palestine op-ed that ran in the Tufts Daily last year. However, and this is coming from someone who worked for a college newspaper for well over a decade, it's actually pretty mild by college-paper opinion-page standards. And even if it wasn't mild, free speech is not a crime. We've had a few messages from readers who say, First Amendment or not, they're not too sad that the Trump administration is targeting the most outspoken pro-Palestine/anti-Israel protesters. Those who feel this way should remember that these things always start with the easiest targets, and then move on from there. As chance would have it, when Ozturk was arrested while walking down a Boston street, she happened to be within the field of someone's home security cameras. And so, the whole incident was caught on camera: It's pretty scary stuff. She was minding her own business, and then was suddenly surrounded by half a dozen men in dark clothing and hoodies. As far as she knew, she was about to be raped or kidnapped (if the latter thought crossed her mind, she wasn't exactly wrong). In a matter of seconds, she's cuffed, and shoved into a car, with her next stop being Louisiana, where her lawyers have been unable to make contact with her. A major point of these grad-student arrests, besides scoring points with the base, is to silence dissent. Someone in the Trump administration is clever enough to know that large-scale campus protests were absolutely lethal for more than one president, most obviously Lyndon B. Johnson, but also Joe Biden/Kamala Harris. And the scheme has been pretty successful, at least in the short term. Students and faculty who might be tempted to protest, particularly to protest what's going on in Gaza, are largely scared stiff, for fear that they'll be the next person to end up in a Louisiana gulag. But suppression of free speech is not usually an effective long-term play. Eventually, as anger intensifies, and as it spreads to more people, things tend to pop, like a cork in a champagne bottle. And the video of Ozturk is bad enough that it has led to mass outrage and mass protests in Boston, both on campus and off. That's 2,000 people in the former case, and 1,000 in the latter, who were roused to action less than 24 hours after Ozturk was arrested and the video was made public. We believe that while the Trump administration may win the early battles, they are going to lose the war. Eventually, the universities and the law firms and the news outlets are going to realize that this is a ""Join or Die"" situation, and that accommodating Trump just encourages more and more predations by him and his administration. These days, we regularly think of India, circa 1946. The people of India were kept under the thumb of the British for a long time. But when tens of millions of those people finally decided that they had bloody well had enough, even the mighty British empire was powerless to maintain its grip. (Z) Last week, we only gave one hint as to the headline theme, because the weekend posts were canceled due to illness. That hint was that we intended to run the headline ""We Don't Need No Education, Part II: The Trump Administration Is Re-Whiting History,"" but had to hold that item (and it's still held, due to other, more pressing, news). That one hint was enough, though. Here's reader T.K. in Half Moon Bay, St. Kitts, with the solution: The headlines this week all contain the name of a type of fish: Legal News, Part I: John Roberts Won't Permit This (We Hope) This (We Hope) Legal News, Part II: Paul, Weiss Makes the Best of a Weak Hand ? ? We Don't Need No Education: Antisemitism Was Just a Red Herring I Read the News Today, Oh Boy: Goodbye, Blue Sky Sky This Week in Schadenfreude: What a Wahoo This Week in Freudenfreude: See a Pike, Open the Dike There is not such a thing as a Weakhandfish. However, there is a Weakfish and a Handfish, so either of those counts. From the headline that did not happen, a whiting is a kind of fish. And a salmon, from this headline, is also a kind of fish, of course. Well, that and a former Angels outfielder. Here are the first 50 readers to get it right: N.H. in London, England, UK R.D. in Cheshire, CT R.C. in Eagleville, PA P.Q. in Metuchen, NJ T.K. in Half Moon Bay J.T. in Philadelphia, PA R.D.K. in Ebensee am Traunsee, Austria J.N. in Zionsville, IN M.A. in Boston, MA J.H. in Flint, MI S.J.V. in New York City, NY M.S. in Canton, NY D.K. in Bethesda, MD D.L. in Uslar, Germany K.H. in Maryville, TN J.D.W. in Baltimore, MD M.M. in Dunellen, NJ J.M. in Eagle Mills, NY G.W. in Avon, CT M.J. in Oakdale, MN J.L. in Walnut Creek, CA M.L. in West Hartford, CT S.K. in Ardmore, PA G.G. in Nottinghamshire, UK, England T.T. in Conway, AR H.B. in Toronto, ON, Canada D.D. in Carversville, PA A.A. in Branchport, NY M.T. in Wheat Ridge, CO D.S. in Nashua, NH D.S. in Layton, UT M.K. in Long Branch, NJ T.C. in Key West, FL W.M. in Istanbul, Turkey J.T. in Madison, WI P.R. in Kirksville, MO G.K. in Blue Island, IL D.L. in Springfield, IL S.W. in Winter Garden, FL D.W. in Manhattan, MT R.M. in Ocala, FL H.H. in Boston, MA A.S.F. in Chelmsford, MA H.S. in Lake Forest, CA K.C. in Los Angeles, CA K.R. in Austin, TX M.D. in North Canton, OH P.J. in Delaware, OH R.A. in Chesterfield, MO P.L. in Skövde, Sweden The 50th correct response was received at 7:22 a.m. PT on Friday. As to this week's theme, it is in the Trivial Pursuit category Arts and Entertainment. Actually, it could go in another classic Trivial Pursuit category, but under the rules used by the publisher, Arts and Entertainment is the correct choice. It relies on one word per headline and, because we did not feel right making a game out of people losing their jobs, out of extreme abortion policies, or out of scapegoating immigrants, those three headlines are not part of the puzzle. For a hint, we'll say that it's a VERY timely theme. That's probably not quite enough, so we'll also give an answer key of sorts for the five headlines that are part of the puzzle: 1B2BLFPC. That answer key is in the correct order, by the way. If you have a guess, send it to comments@electoral-vote.com with subject line ""March 28 Headlines."" (Z) There are roughly 56,000 people living in Greenland, and the average household size there is about 3.5 people. That means there are roughly 16,000 households. Today, J.D. Vance and his wife Usha are scheduled to visit the U.S. Space Force Base at Pituffik, which is pretty small, and has a contingent of only about 150 people. It's a 7-hour flight each way, and so the Trump administration might like to get a bit more mileage out of the trip than can be gotten out of a tour of such a small installation. Consequently, the U.S. government's advance team went door-to-door, desperately trying to set up a photo-op for the second couple during their visit. Among those 16,000 households, they could not find a single taker. Actually, that is not entirely true. Originally, the trip was going to include only the Second Lady. And while that was the case, there were a few Greenlanders willing to put out the welcome mat. She was going to visit a local business, and was going to fire the starter's pistol for a dogsled race. But once her husband announced he was coming along, all of the invitations were yanked. The people of Greenland are clever enough to know that: (1) the whole point of the trip, initially, was to generate some ""Greenland wants to be American"" propaganda; (2) the itinerary was updated to the space base, as we noted yesterday, to save face when it became clear that Greenlanders don't want to be American, and don't want to be subjects of any propaganda that suggests otherwise; and (3) the would-be photo-op is a cheap attempt to sneak some of that propaganda in, anyhow. So, they were willing to shake hands and pose for an awkward picture or two with Usha Vance, but the moment that J.D. Vance got involved, then it got far too official looking and far too close to Donald Trump himself, and the Greenlanders said ""No way."" In view of this, at this point, there is some question as to whether or not the Vances will even bother to make the trip. And that brings us to the real point of this item. At the moment, at least on the surface, it looks like Vance is the frontrunner in the race to inherit the MAGA throne. He's well-known, he's a Trump insider, he's 2-for-2 in campaigns for office, and he'll say or do whatever it takes to lick Trump's boots (or anything else that needs to be licked). However, we are skeptical this can last for 4 full years (or 3, really, since the next presidential cycle will get underway in spring of 2027). Here are three major problems that Vance has, in our view: Vance Is Weird : Maybe it's his odd, cherubic visage. Maybe it's the (alleged) eyeliner. Maybe it's the voice. Maybe it's the herky-jerky speaking style. Whatever it is, Vance very clearly sets off many people's ""weird"" alarms. Some politicians don't, some politicians do, and he definitely does. For example, just two weeks ago, in this very space, we had a rundown of surreal Vance memes. It's Urban Folklore 101 that if so many memes like that, about the same person, reach a wide audience, it is a clear indication that something is rubbing people the wrong way. We have our doubts that Trump will ever really anoint a successor, either overtly or subtly. Really, he is the type of person who would enjoy watching the bloodsport as various pretenders to the throne try to knife each other. But if he does get behind Dear Leader v2.0, whoever that person might be, we just can't see him summoning up any enthusiasm for Vance. Trump likes the ""cool kids"" (so he can pretend that he is one of them), and hates to associate himself with losers and nerds. Vance is a geeky technocrat, which is just a fancy way of saying ""nerd."" It is for this same basic reason that Trump Sr. has never shown the slightest interest in making Trump Jr. the heir to the throne. Dad doesn't respect Junior, and the only child he DOES respect (Ivanka) has no further interest in politics. : Maybe it's his odd, cherubic visage. Maybe it's the (alleged) eyeliner.

It is for this same basic reason that Trump Sr. has never shown the slightest interest in making Trump Jr. the heir to the throne. Dad doesn't respect Junior, and the only child he DOES respect (Ivanka) has no further interest in politics. Vance Is Too Independent : As we note above, Vance is happy to do whatever bootlicking he needs to do, at least in public. In private, as indicated by the Signal chat, he's rather less obeisant. One has to imagine that the chat did not happen to be the one and only time Vance (carelessly) dared to be critical of Trump. And even if it was somehow the only time, Trump is now on notice. As we have noted many times (including yesterday), the President does not forget or forgive slights, no matter how slight they might be. At least one Republican senator, who only spoke on condition of anonymity, is thinking along the same lines as us. Speaking to Jewish Insider , this senator said: ""I've gotta wonder if Trump's looking at this and going, 'What have I done?' Trump might come to regret anointing Vance as his heir apparent by tapping him as his running mate last year."" : As we note above, Vance is happy to do whatever bootlicking he needs to do, at least in public.

Trump might come to regret anointing Vance as his heir apparent by tapping him as his running mate last year."" Vance Is Un-Fireable : To the extent that Trump has a leadership style, it's rooted in his ability to fire or banish his underlings at a moment's notice. As long as a person is 100% on board the S.S. Trump, and as long as a person doesn't become a liability in some way (legal, P.R., etc.), he's willing to keep them around and to allow them to be ""insiders."" Mike Flynn, Stephen Miller, Roger Stone, Linda McMahon, etc. know how to play the game, and that is why they have survived, traveling a road that is jammed with the corpses of former Trump loyalists. The one person in the White House who Trump absolutely cannot fire is Vance. And the President clearly does not enjoy operating without that kind of leverage. Yes, he can exile Vance from the inner circle, and limit him to cutting the ribbon at openings of Piggly Wiggly locations. But Trump prefers underlings he can cast out of paradise entirely, and he can't do that with Vance. By virtue of being VP, Vance will always have a platform in a way that would not be true if, say, Stephen Miller somehow became ""former Trump administration insider Stephen Miller."" Indeed, we cannot help but notice that even now, despite his ostensible high profile, the Vance vice presidency is unfolding much like the Mike Pence vice presidency. Remember, for example, when Pence was deployed to an Indianapolis Colts game for some embarrassing political theater centered on kneeling football players? Well, that was in October 2017, about eight months into Trump v1.0. And we all know what eventually happened with Pence, who was neutered well before he refused to participate in the 1/6 coup. We're just 2 months into Trump v2.0, and Vance is already drawing embarrassing assignments, like going to Greenland despite the fact that nobody wants him there. Sure looks to us like history is repeating itself. (Z) This is an odd story, in many ways, but we think the ultimate outcome is a positive one, so we're going with it. It has been a shade less than 3 years since former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe was assassinated. The man responsible for that crime, Tetsuya Yamagami, said that he did it because Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) were in bed with the Unification Church. And the Unification Church, as part of its approach, is in the habit of shaking down adherents for all of their assets. Yamagami feels that the Church is responsible for his family's financial ruin, and that Abe and the LDP are, in effect, accessories. Since the Unification Church (Full name: Family Federation for World Peace and Unification) is based in South Korea, it's beyond the reach of a Japanese national. Abe, by contrast, was not. Hence the assassination. And now, the most unusual aspect of the story. The Japanese government has spent the years since Abe's death investigating Yamagami's claims, and concluded that he's 100% correct. His family really was ruined by the Unification Church. Abe and the LDP really were in bed with the Church; more than three-quarters of LDP members in the Japanese Parliament had received financial support from the Church. And so, while the assassination certainly was not legal, it was rational. Undoubtedly, Luigi Mangione smiled and nodded when he heard about this story. Consequently, although this is not generally how this is supposed to work, the Japanese government got to work trying to solve the problem that Yamagami, in violent fashion, had highlighted. Prosecutors took the Unification Church to court, and this week they won. Assuming the decision stands up on appeal, the Unification Church will lose its tax-exempt status and will have to surrender its ill-gotten gains. And this is actually the third time Japan has implemented this penalty; the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult (sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subways) and Myokakuji group (gross fraud) got the same treatment. We take the view that there's something very positive in making clear that if a religious group abuses its privileged legal, economic and cultural status, then it loses that status. If Japanese people still want to be members of the Unification Church, they are free to act on that. It's just that the government won't give the Church an assist anymore. Would 'twere certain other nations had that same policy (oh and, by the way, the Unification Church has also cultivated a relationship with every Republican president since 1968, except for Jerry Ford).

Victoria Lee, a tenant there, used our OrganizeFor platform to mobilize thousands of members and amplify tenant demands to fix the plumbing, honor leases, and support tenants who’d been illegally pushed out. Many families were given eviction notices on New Year’s Eve for no reason at all and given just 30 days to find a new home. One mother reported having to go to the corner store to use the bathroom as raw sewage backed up in her tub. Management all but ignored calls for help and she had to call out of work for days because she couldn’t shower. After the online petition and a sleep-in protest, Palm Communities agreed to honor residents’ leases, provide temporary housing for displaced residents, and resolve maintenance issues.

projectcensored.org,left,Promoting Critical Media Literacy,"We seek to ensure that news stories that have the greatest implications for the people of the United States get more coverage than those that are sensational or simply entertaining. Our goal is to enlighten people about the stories they don’t hear—”the news that didn’t make the news”—that are likely to affect their lives (and the lives of their children) far into the future. From this perspective, journalism undertaken in the public interest can stimulate people to act in ways that make a difference. An informed public is crucial to democracy in at least two basic ways. First, without access to relevant news and opinion, people cannot fully participate in government. Second, without media literacy, people cannot evaluate for themselves the quality or significance of the news they receive. Project Censored’s work highlights the important links among a free press, media literacy, and democratic self-government. This is why we promote public awareness of, trust in, and support for independent news sources that provide meaningful alternatives to corporate news reporting. Our promotion of independent journalism includes tools for educators and the general public to enhance peoples’ critical media literacy skills, and therefore enrich each persons’ interactions with news media.",https://projectcensored.org,homepage_scrape

lesswrong.com,center,LessWrong,"In response to an email about what a pro-human ideology for the future looks like, I wrote up the following: The pro-human egregore I'm currently designing (which I call fractal empowerment) incorporates three key ideas: Firstly, we can see virtue ethics as a way for less powerful agents to aggregate to form more powerful superagents that preserve the interests of those original less powerful agents. E.g. virtues like integrity, loyalty, etc help prevent divide-and-conquer strategies. This would have been in the interests of the rest of the world when Europe was trying to colonize them, and will be in the best interests of humans when AIs try to conquer us. Secondly, the most robust way for a more powerful agent to be altruistic towards a less powerful agent is not for it to optimize for that agent's welfare, but rather to optimize for its empowerment. This prevents predatory strategies from masquerading as altruism (e.g. agents claiming ""I'll conquer you and then I'll empower you"", which then somehow never get around to the second step). Thirdly: the generational contract. From any given starting point, there are a huge number of possible coalitions which could form, and in some sense it's arbitrary which set of coalitions you choose. But one thing which is true for both humans and AIs is that each generation wants to be treated well by the next generation. And so the best intertemporal Schelling point is for coalitions to be inherently historical: that is, they balance the interests of old agents and new agents (even when the new agents could in theory form a coalition against all the old agents). From this perspective, path-dependence is a feature not a bug: there are many possible futures but only one history, meaning that this single history can be used to coordinate. In some sense this is a core idea of UDT: when coordinating with forks of yourself, you defer to your unique last common ancestor. When it's not literally a fork of yourself, there's more arb",https://lesswrong.com,homepage_scrape

agdaily.com,center,"Agriculture News, Trends & Farming Videos","Farm ownership is a demanding profession with significant mental health challenges. The unique pressures of the role, combined with severe mental health care barriers, affect farmers across the country. Recent research from the University of Georgia College of Public Health sheds light on the stressors female farm owners and managers face — challenges that can be overlooked in broader studies of agricultural well-being. Through a series of interviews, researchers identified key stressors for this population, including animal mortality, succession planning for farms, and the impact of gender roles and stereotypes. “Physically, you’re worried about injuries and illnesses, all those traditional stressors that farmers face,” said Christina Proctor, lead author and associate professor of health promotion and behavior. “But then the women in these leadership roles are also thinking, ‘How am I going to act in a way that the men working in this occupation respect me and see me as their leader or their boss?’” Animal loss, succession planning at front of mind A key insight from the study was the toll of animal loss. This was not seen as commonly in interviews with male farmers, Proctor said. “Female farmers were really stressed about how people outside of the farming community viewed their relationship with their animals,” Proctor said. “They said, ‘While they’re our animals, we feel like we’re guardians and need to protect them.’ When they lose one of them, it’s really hard.” Stress associated with animal wellbeing may be exacerbated in times where animal disease is more prevalent, an important consideration given recent news about the spread of bird flu in the United States. Proctor noted that while both male and female farmers talked about operational continuity in interviews, female farmers identified succession planning as a major source of stress, with women facing more difficulties when coming into ownership. Perspectives varied among farmers. First-generation farmers were concerned about working hard to establish the farm and wanted someone to continue that legacy. Others, including a few fifth-generation farmers, worried about being “the woman who loses the farm,” said Proctor. Gender disparities, stereotypes add new layer of stress The study also found that female farmers grapple with broader gender disparities in agriculture. Many feel pressure to prove themselves and navigate expectations that they must be both authoritative leaders and nurturing caretakers. Some adopt more traditionally masculine traits to gain respect, often leading to internal conflict. “The conflict between the necessity of working long hours to keep the farm running and the expectation of keeping up with housework and childcare duties was a major stressor for many of the women we spoke with,” said study co-author and doctoral student Noah Hopkins. “As I was doing the interviews, I was blown away by the women and what they have to do on a day-to-day basis. Just being a female farmer is amazing,” Proctor said, “but then trying to navigate the cultural nuances that exist in being a female that works in a male-dominated sector is its own challenge.” One interviewee noted that when people see her on the farm or in her office, they ask for “the bossman” and assume she is not the one in charge. Even when they are the primary decision maker, male family members will be addressed first. Building community and resources Gathering data is an important step toward finding the best ways to support female farmers. “Farmers are already very isolated,” Proctor said. “If you’re the only woman within four counties, how do we connect you with other women who are doing this? It starts with more peer-to-peer programs and more spaces for female agricultural leaders to get together just to talk about these things.” These changes can benefit farming overall, Proctor said. Female farmers tend to lean into communal leadership, empathize with laborers and work collaboratively. These farms see more sustainable practices regarding work/life balance and community building, and studies have shown that this practice can improve rates of poverty in communities where it is implemented. “I think farming and agriculture will benefit greatly for more female leadership,” Proctor said. “Right now, if it’s really hard for women to work in that sector, we need to ask ourselves, ‘How do we create programs or initiatives that ensure more women feel comfortable going into those spaces and represented within agricultural meetings, commodity meetings and more?’” The study was also co-authored by masters’ student Chase Reece and Lauren Ledbetter Griffeth, UGA Cooperative Extension leadership specialist.",https://agdaily.com,homepage_scrape

studentsforliberty.org,center,Students For Liberty – A Freer Future,"A Wild, Rewarding Weekend — Minute by Minute Technically, LibertyCon International, 2025 didn’t start until Friday, February 7th. But for me, the mad, glorious, and adrenaline-and-caffeine-and-passion-fueled rush of it all began the night before, at the Cato Institute. I was there listening to a panel of SFL alumni. From left: Moderator and Cato Legal Associate Ethan Yang; Pericles Niarchos, who works at Cato as Associate Director of Libertarianism.org; Rachel Altman of the Foundation for American Innovation; and Trace Mitchell, who works on a House of Representatives subcommittee for regulatory reform (among other things). From there, I was planning to walk to Union Market, where Young Voices and the American Institute for Economic Research were hosting a debate on sports betting. But as you’ll see, sometimes at LibertyCon, you just have to go with the flow. Thursday Thursday, 5:46 p.m. — Already stayed at Cato too long … Google said it was a 45-minute walk, and the debate starts in 44 minutes … but I just can’t bring myself to leave yet; I’m loving this conversation. 5:58 p.m. — Ok, no choice now: I’ll Uber in a little bit. 6:17 p.m. — I should have checked earlier; Uber tells me it’s 21 minutes (to drive 1.9 miles). I guess D.C. traffic really is that bad. 6:19 p.m. — You know, I can probably RUN two miles in less than 21 minutes … 6:21 p.m. — And I need the exercise anyway; let’s go. 6:28 p.m. — I should not have eaten so many cashews this afternoon. 6:42 p.m. — Exactly 21 minutes after leaving, I’m a block away from the debate venue. And oh, hi, LibertyCon Director Andrew Freo and wife, Erica! No … I’m … not … out of … breath. Why? 8:51 p.m. — Debate was fun! Verdict: the government is not fit to restrict sports betting (or any other peaceful, consensual activity). I walk back toward Cato to check out the post-panel social at a rooftop bar. Surely it’s over by now. 9:32 p.m. — Wrong! The rooftop is full of SFL alumni and staff from all over the world, all exuding that jet-lagged desire to stay awake until a normal bedtime. 9:57 p.m. For me, however, this is a normal bedtime, and it’s gonna be a busy weekend. I pull the old [insert one of various nationalities here; many claim it as theirs] goodbye tactic, where I leave quietly, without telling anyone, so as not to bring the mood down. Friday Friday, 10:03 a.m. — I meet Mike Sertic, President of The Advocates for Self-Government. I’m interviewing him for a video about how SFL shaped his life and career. He’s about the humblest person I’ve ever met (but I get him to brag about himself, just a bit). 11:24 a.m. — Most of the signage is up; people are trickling into the conference center … 🎵It’s beginning to look a lot like LibertyCon 🎵 11:51 a.m. — I step outside for the first time today. Hey, a bench, right in the bright sunshine? Don’t mind if I do! 12:08 p.m. — Should I have another coffee? Eh, I don’t think I need it. 1:06 p.m. — Interview #2 for the day, this time podcast-style with professional wrestler Nic Nemeth, aka Dolph Ziggler. I’m a sports fan, but I have to admit: Wrestling is new to me. 2:18 p.m. — As we’re finishing a fun chat about the meritocracy of sports and the recent intersection of hand-to-hand combat sports and politics, who should drop by? Former Wrestler and current Mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, Glenn Jacobs. Leam, our resident wrestling aficionado, is beaming, seeing two of his heroes up close, in person. 4:00 p.m. — Registration for LibertyCon begins. Lanyards and tote bags are being handed out, badges and nametags are being affixed … it’s go time. 4:34 p.m. — Pro tip: The Cato table always has an impressive stack of free books. (One of the reasons we gave out those nice, green tote bags!) I pick up a few; the woman behind the table says, “All I ask for in exchange is that you tell me who the face in at the top-left of the book cover is.” It’s Modern Libertarianism: A Brief History of Classical Liberalism in the United States by Brian Doherty. “Well,” I say, “I can tell you Rand is at the top-right … Milton Friedman is lower-left … Hayek is lower-right.” She says, “I know, those are easy. But who’s this guy?” She points again to the top left. “I will make it my mission to find out,” I say. 4:34:30 p.m. — As I leave, the man behind me approaches the table. He recognizes the woman I was talking to; they seem like old friends. “Did I hear right,” he says, “that you and your husband were potentially going to reproduce?” 5:27 p.m. — You know how your feet start to hurt at a museum, because you’re on your feet for hours straight, but not actually walking, just kinda shuffling, and therefore not properly distributing your body weight? That’s my life right now, as I shuffle from table to table in the exhibition room. 6:01 p.m. — I arrive at the main stage for the opening remarks, but they are not going to start on time. 6:03 p.m. — You know what? OF COURSE they weren’t going to start on time; they knew stragglers like me would be late. Be the change you wish to see in the world, Trevor. Be punctual from now on. 6:06 p.m. — As a few final stragglers trickle in, Robby Soave from Reason takes the stage to applause from a packed auditorium. 7:03 p.m. — I literally — in the true, pre-Millennial sense of that word — cannot believe what I’m seeing: a KKK robe and hood and a Nazi flag on the main stage. Except tonight, they’re trophies won by Daryl Davis, a black musician who convinced their former owners to give them up for good. I’m thinking about what those symbols typically represent — the fear and hatred they’ve conjured for millions of people — and then I think about what they mean, here and now, in this context: symbols of how love and communication and understanding can conquer hatred. Davis said: “Why do I have these? Because [their former owners] no longer have use for them. They don’t believe in these anymore.” I’m so happy I could cry. Editor’s note: Although in Mr. Davis’s hands, those images represent how people can change, they were still difficult to look at. Truly — I shuddered at first. Should you want to watch it, his entire presentation, along with the rest of Day 1’s main-stage programming, was streamed by CiVL, HERE. 7:55 p.m. — Jeez, this debate between Bryan Caplan and Daniel Di Martino debate on immigration is getting HEATED! I love it. 8:43 p.m. — Hi, Rashid! I run into a friend of mine, and one of our three nominees for Student of the Year, in the lobby. He’s making a documentary about the history of SFL, and he asks to interview ME, of all people, for it. Meet downstairs at 9:00? Sure. 8:44 p.m. — See you in a few, Rashid, I’m just gonna run up to my room for a minute and … oh and hi, Stephen Kent! Another friend, author of How the Force Can Fix the World, and featured expert for What Makes a Disney Villain Work has arrived. He’s here for Liberty Jeopardy! 8:54 p.m. — I catch the upward elevator with a co-worker. I press the button for the 16th floor and he presses the one for the … SECOND floor? “You couldn’t take the stairs up one floor?” I ask, my tone more serious than I intended. I’m in a hurry; I don’t want to be late again, but that’s no excuse for being rude. I’m sorry, Florian. 9:03 p.m. — Rashid asks me about SFL’s impact around the world, and it’s impressive. (Just read the Annual Report.) But at the end of a day full of running around and shaking hands and interviews and lectures, I’m not sharp, and the numbers don’t come to me. I hope he finds someone much, much more qualified than me to interview. 10:27 p.m. — Liberty Jeopardy! is an absolute joy to end the day with. Granted, it’s hard to keep track of the scores without a scoreboard, but the questions are great and host Brian Lambrecht’s energy is contagious. 11:14 p.m. — I’m sure there’s a party going on somewhere, but now I’m in bed. Do I have the energy to crack open my new copy of John Mackey’s The Whole Story? I read a paragraph about … Zzzzzzzzzz. Saturday Saturday, 8:11 a.m. — The CiVL coffee meet and greet is the perfect place to ask: “Hey, who’s this face in the upper-left-hand corner of this cover?” Two people say practically the same thing: They immediately identify Rand, Friedman, and Hayek, but they’re stumped on the fourth and we’re no closer to solving our mystery. 9:00 a.m. — I’d always wanted to take a deep dive into the 16th Amendment and the Internal Revenue Code, and Peymon Mottahedeh delivers. He says, with a lot of supporting evidence, that the federal income tax applies only to residents of Washington, D.C. I definitely need to stop by his Freedom Law School table to ask some follow-ups. 9:59 a.m. — In the foyer, Keaton Powell tells me, “There’s two seats left for Judy Shelton … she was nominated to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve. It’s in Salon F. Wanna come?” Why yes, I sure do. 10:28 a.m. — I leave her panel a few minutes early; I had promised Mike I would come by his lecture, introducing attendees to, and asking them for suggestions on how to improve, the World’s Smallest Political Quiz. And I walk in just as he takes the mic. 11:02 a.m. — Have I eaten yet? No. Is the hotel still serving breakfast? 11:04 a.m. — Yes! In honor of Ron Swanson, who appeared on a life-sized cut-out at the Being Libertarian table I visited earlier, I eat all of the scrambled eggs and bacon. 11:40 a.m. — I set up my camera outside Salon E to ask people to re-tell their stories of online censorship under the guise of safety, so we can report back to NetChoice, who sponsored this session. If you think censorship is bad here in the U.S., just talk to some folks from Asia. 12:00 p.m. — I want to be on time, and I’m glad I am because there aren’t many seats left, for David Friedman’s lecture about market failure. 12:08 p.m. — He makes me wonder: What do I believe that isn’t true, just because it’s in my best interests to believe it? 12:21 p.m. — Aha; that’s it! I believe that cheering loudly at sporting events can affect the outcome, even though I know in reality, it probably doesn’t. This comes to me when Dr. Friedman says, “Consider why people attend football and baseball games, where teams are associated with their cities or universities. Part of it is so they can cheer for their side and think they can make a tiny difference in the outcome. The same phenomenon is at play with voting.” 12:33 p.m. — I ask the guy sitting next to me, “Hey, whose face is this?” He responds, “That’s Murray Rothbard.” 12:34 p.m. — “Let me see that again,” he says. “Yeah, it’s Rothbard. I’m pretty sure.” 2:19 p.m. — I’m panicking: I have misplaced my green tote bag with all my notes in it, plus my copy of Doherty’s Modern Libertarianism, without which I might never find my answer. It’s not in my room. It’s not in the staff room, either. And there are, like, a thousand other identical green bags at this conference. 2:31 p.m. — (It WAS in the staff room.) 3:01 p.m. — I drop by the Liberty Seeds table and meet Alex Yershov. He gives me four packets of liberty seeds: artful business cards with inspirational, liberty-oriented quotes from famous classical liberals on the back. I’ve been “planting” these seeds by slyly leaving them behind in lockers at the gym, in cupholders at basketball games, even on a friend’s easy chair. “Free enterprise capitalism is not only a possible system to end world poverty, it is the only morally desirable system to achieve it.” -Javier Milei, via Liberty Seeds 3:03 p.m. — Back in the exhibition room, the CEO of Freedom Law School answers all of my tough, direct questions rather convincingly. He says none of their clients have actually been imprisoned or had their wages garnished by the IRS, and they’re going on 30 years in operation. 4:13 p.m. — Random guy I walk up to: “Could it be Ronald Coase?” Me: “I truly don’t know; I’ve been asking people all weekend.” A woman who overhears our conversation: “I think that’s Mises.” Another guy nearby: “That’s Barry Goldwater, right?” 4:25 p.m. — Bah god, that’s Dolph Ziggler’s music! He takes the main stage as part of a panel of entertainers who tell how they came around to classical liberalism. You can watch all of Saturday’s main-stage programming, including this panel, HERE. 5:13 p.m. — I am hearing reports that it’s raining outside. If I step out for some fresh air, will my suit be ruined? 6:30 p.m. — I missed Robby Soave’s closing remarks; I wasn’t emotionally ready for LibertyCon to be over. And when I walk into Salon F for the Bastiat House (learn more about them HERE) debate tournament championship, it’s clear that Marcos Batista and Co. are not ready, either. They’re just getting started! 7:26 p.m. — I swing by the VIP room and oh boy oh boy oh boy is that who I think it is? See, I met this good-looking lady at LibertyCon in Miami a couple years ago, we had nice conversation, but I never saw her again … until now, I think? 7:26:01 — Suit survived the rain … but my hair might still be a little damp. Does my breath smell like bacon? Is that a wedding ring or an Oura ring? 7:27 p.m. — Before I can find out, everyone is ushered down to dinner and I lose her in the crowd. Eh, we live half a continent away, it never would’ve worked. 8:34 p.m. — Glenn Jacobs takes the stage as keynote speaker. He’s read Human Action and grew up a St. louis Cardinals fan! If I lived in Tennessee, he might just have my vote. 9:23 p.m. — At the end of a gracious and humble speech, our Alum of the Year, Aimable Manirakiza, deviates ever so slightly from that humility and gets a big laugh. “Long life to you, long life to Students For Liberty, and long life to me,” he says. 10:02 p.m. — Is that SFL’s very own North American Programs Director, Florian, at stage left, playing bass for Daryl Davis!? I guess he didn’t lose too much sleep over my bad elevator etiquette. 10:34 p.m. — The Brazilians are coming; the Brazilians are coming! Three of our Brazilian students have requested the band play a samba and have taken over the microphones. 10:39 p.m. — The Cato folks left a big box of books behind on their table … and Modern Libertarianism is sitting there on top! Having left my green tote bag securely up in my room, this is a sign from above: I’m gonna get my answer. 10:41 p.m. — Dennis Jose, SFL’s South Asia Programs Manager, is standing just outside the ballroom. I ask him. “That’s Barry Goldwater,” he says. I say: “How sure are you?” 10:42 p.m. — He opens a facial recognition app and scans the face. But it’s a drawing, so that’s no use. 10:43 p.m. — “I’m positive,” he says. I say back: “Alright, tell you what: If you’re so sure, I’ll give you a dollar right now. If I find out otherwise, you’ll donate your next paycheck to SFL. How’s that sound?” He thinks about it for a second: “That’s a win-win, but I’m sure. Deal.” 10:58 p.m. — I drop by the VIP room again. No sign of anyone this time, just an abandoned table full of international hors d’oeuvres: Japanese peanuts, Mexican dulces, Chinese White Rabbit candies, seaweed from … wherever seaweed comes from. We’re an international organization, after all. And It Stoned Me by Van Morrison is playing softly over the speakers and you know how sometimes, the perfect song is playing at the perfect time at the perfect place? This is that; slow and soft and melancholy notes fall over the empty room because LibertyCon is now officially over and we have to wait another year for this wild and stressful and inspiring and reinvigorating and just plain fun runaround of a weekend to return. (Unless you can make it to Prague for LibertyCon Europe in April.) I think about that old line from German poet Ludwig Jacobowski: “Don’t cry because it’s over; smile because it happened.” And then I see that Van Morrison himself said this song is about a time when, “For five minutes everything was really quiet and I was in this other dimension,” and that’s exactly what LibertyCon is, if you put your heart and soul into it: a vessel to another dimension, another state of mind, where you realize how awesome people are and how beautiful life is and how much better it will get if only we can make our message of free minds and free markets ring true, the world over. 11:04 p.m. — Ex. Haus. Ted. My right wrist hurts from so many handshakes. Business cards and pins and liberty seeds and pamphlets and little scraps of paper with notes on them spill out of my pockets as I change to get ready for bed. Let’s see if I can make it through that chapter about Mackey’s … Zzzzzzz. Postscript: Tuesday Tuesday, 8:57 a.m. — From: Trevor Kraus <[email protected]> to: bdoherty [Subject: Your book cover] Hey Brian, I was at LibertyCon over the weekend and picked up a copy of Modern Libertarianism … I started asking around, and no one could be 100% sure that the face in the upper-left-hand corner of the cover was Barry Goldwater. We even ran a facial recognition scan. It IS Barry Goldwater, right? 11:52 a.m. — From: bdoherty to: Trevor Kraus <[email protected]> [Subject: Re: Your book cover] “That was the intent, yes.” 11:53 a.m. — Dennis, you’re off the hook.

techdirt.com,center,Techdirt.,"from the what-are-you-patriotic-for? dept Is it a flag on your porch? A sense of pride during the national anthem? A particular vision of freedom or prosperity? Perhaps it’s a story you tell yourself about who we are and what we stand for. Whatever it means to you, I want you to hold that meaning close as you read what follows. On March 15, three planes touched down in El Salvador. They carried 261 men deported from the United States. Most were Venezuelans—people who fled one nightmare only to be thrust into another. They were designated as “gang members” by the current administration and deported with little or no due process. No trials. No evidence presented. Just labeled, processed, and removed. What happened next should shatter any comfortable notions of what American values mean in practice. These men—human beings with names, histories, dreams—were marched through a gauntlet of armed guards, beaten, stripped naked, shaved, and thrown into overcrowded cells. A photojournalist on the scene described watching men age a decade in two hours. He watched as one young man sobbed, “I’m not a gang member. I’m gay. I’m a barber.” This man was slapped for his tears, beaten for his vulnerability. No phone calls. No visitors. No books. No talking. Just exile to a place “so cold and far from home they may as well have been sent into space, nameless and forgotten.” And all of this—every slap, every sob, every stolen dignity—stamped with American approval. Coordinated with American officials. Executed with American efficiency. We have turned away from Lincoln’s better angels. We have abandoned the moral arc that has, despite our many failures, generally bent toward justice. The world is afraid of us now—not with the complicated respect of a moral superpower, but with the simple fear reserved for bullies and tyrants. Some of my conservative friends say that’s good. Good that people are afraid. That fear makes them feel strong. I just don’t know what kind of morals people have, that they seek to be feared. That’s not manly. That’s not something to be proud of. It’s crude. It’s barbarism. Being feared isn’t strength. True strength lies in being just when it would be easier to be cruel. In maintaining our principles when they’re inconvenient. In seeing the humanity in others even when it would be politically expedient to deny it. What kind of nation have we become that we measure our greatness not by who we protect but by who we can brutalize? Not by what we build but by what we destroy? The man who cried for his mother as his hair fell to the floor—he is not an abstraction. The barber who begged to be recognized as human—he is not a statistic. They are people. And what we allow to happen to them defines us more surely than any pledge or anthem or flag ever could. This is the true test of what being an American means: not what we proclaim when standing tall at a ballgame or wrapping ourselves in patriotic symbols, but what we permit to be done to the vulnerable when we think no one is watching. Two plus two equals four. There are twenty-four hours in a day. And we have really failed ourselves here. Failed to hold the tension between security and humanity. Failed to push back the flood of cruelty that always threatens to overwhelm civilization. Failed to walk the wire between legitimate concerns about immigration and our fundamental obligations to human dignity. America, look at what is being done in your name. Look, and tell me if this is truly what you meant when you spoke of your pride in being American. Because a nation that can do this—that can coordinate the ritualized dehumanization of people without trial, without evidence, without the most basic protections of due process—is not the America I was taught to believe in. It’s not the America worthy of your pride or my loyalty. It’s an America that has forgotten itself. Mike Brock is a former tech exec who was on the leadership team at Block.

therighting.com,center,theRighting – Alerting Mainstream Audiences to Today’s Headlines from the Right,"Greetings! Another day, another Wall Street Journal op-ed slamming Donald Trump’s bumbling response to Signalgate. Conservative columnist Peggy Noonan writes that it was a mistake to attack Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg who found himself on a group chat with White House insiders discussing an imminent military strike. “Instead they denied the obvious and attacked the character of the reporter who unearthed it. They misread what Jeffrey Goldberg would do if they challenged his accuracy or interpretations,” she wrote. “He published the whole lot. Which made them look stupid twice. They didn’t look like clever folk who are good strategists”… Fashion fail: Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem toured El Salvador’s most notorious prison two days ago. She wore a body-clinging white top over tight Western-style jeans as she strolled past dozens of incarcerated young men. It was almost like she was taunting them as an object of desire just beyond their reach. It struck me as cruel and unnecessary. Axios has some great images. Worth noting: The Washington Post reports that Noem sported a $50,000 Rolex…Weekend Watch: Earlier this month I flagged the timely documentary Becoming Katherine Graham , about the late fearless and peerless Washington Post publisher. Watching it last night, I marveled at Graham’s nerve standing up to the Nixon White House as the corrupt administration plotted to cripple her media empire for its coverage of Watergate and publication of the Pentagon Papers. It is a profile in courage filled with lessons to be learned for today’s institutions under unprecedented pressure from the Trump 2.0…If you keep reading, I’ll keep Righting. Howard The Nothing-Burger Signal Chat source: WND By Ben Shapiro: This scandal is procedural in nature. It doesn't match up to the ire unleashed by some of the Trump administration's loudest critics. Democrats Have a Signal Problem source: Washington Reporter Democrats have relied on Signal to conduct sensitive business for years, casting doubt on their anger about top Trump administration officials using the app in advance of strikes on Houthi terrorists in Yemen, according to an analysis by the Washington Reporter. The Liberal Media Is “Signaling” a Lot of Bullcrap Right Now source: Townhall Democrats think they smell blood in the water, as the media-manufactured fallout from the leaked Signal chat story continues to make the Left all giddy over nothing.

MTG Plays Sick PBS Programming That Indoctrinates Kids with Drag Queens source: The Gateway Pundit Greene’s subcommittee held a hearing Wednesday as the Committee seeks to defund the far-left state propaganda stations. During the hearing, Greene played a clip of a drag queen featured on PBS’s programming for children as young as three. NPR and PBS Beg for Mercy, But They Don’t Deserve It source: Washington Examiner NPR and PBS used to justify their unjustifiable taxpayer funding by telling people that poor children would be harmed if their educational programming was cut.

I prefer the way you present opposing positions rather than flipping between the talking heads on Fox and MSNBC which seem so disingenuous. I appreciate that you have done the work and filtered for me the most thoughtful and comprehensive position statements.” “I love the juxtaposition of politics and I love that it's a mix of multiple people's opinions rather than reading a long opinion piece by one person. Everyone could benefit from reading this and taking a page out of their opposing party's book. Anytime I start to get into a discussion about politics, I suggest signing up for The Flip Side. I tell them it really helps me to try to understand both sides of the discussion so that I don't form an uninformed bias.” “I love The Flip Side. It is literally the first email I read every morning and I miss it on the weekends! It has helped me so much to see each issue from different perspectives, which is so valuable. I learn things every day, and I recommended it to my mom who loves it too (plus a BUNCH of other friends!). I don't ever plan on unsubscribing. The Flip Side is an absolute benefit in my life :)” “Love TFS! Using it in class for my 11th grade English students. A super accessible resource for argumentative writing and addressing counter arguments!! Y’all should be marketing this to more teachers, for real - I’ve referred y’all a ton already.” “I would rate this service a 10/10! I get this for my debate team to keep up with current events and to use as the basis for motions to debate. It’s a great source for getting a broad overview of a subject or skimming to keep up to date with the few important news stories. I also think the ‘Deep Dive’ series is just right - it’s not sent too often to get annoying and it’s always about topics that are interesting or relevant. Keep up the good work!” “I am a big fan of The Flip Side and use it everyday - actually designed a project around it for my students! Now they recommend it to all their friends too. Keep this important balanced commentary coming!” “Obsessed. It’s helping to save my marriage. I think it’s really important for people to get both sides as the media outlets and politicians are misleading and have caused a lot of hate, broken friendships and divided families. It’s really so sad! At this point, I actually only read The Flip Side.” “This is one of the finest sites that I have stumbled upon. I have sent it out to a few other people and they have also been impressed. Beats literally everything that I have found up to this point. It's exactly what I needed to stay on top of the political topics of the day.

The tuxedo is still the preferred dress in 85% of their business, but less formal wedding locations and wedding fashion are a real part of that scene now. Owner Scott Furman showed us how the traditional men's suit, albeit in black or deep blue for the groom, and groomsmen, is “getting legs.” The suits can be bought or rented like a Tuxedo.

After surviving, if not thriving, under President Trump's first term in office, the business community no longer feared Trump's unpredictability.

krone.at,right,Aktuelle Nachrichten,"das freie Wort Neutralität schützt (nicht) Die erste wirkliche Auslandsreise führte unsere neue Außenministerin gleich in das Kriegsgebiet Ukraine. Dazu drängt sich mir folgende Frage auf: Welche „Neutralität“ meint die Außenministerin eigentlich, wenn sie darüber öffentlich doziert? Meint sie etwa jene, deren Schlüsselposition für diplomatisches Handeln offenkundig längst aufgegeben wurde, weil man sich ausschließlich an einer Union orientiert, die einen Paradigmenwechsel von einer Friedens- zu einer Kriegsunion vollzogen hat und von der sich mittlerweile sogar der Ex-Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker mit Besorgnis abwendet? Meint sie jene Neutralität, die zunehmend weniger auf einer aktiven Friedenspolitik fußt, sondern auf einer Krieg legitimierenden Europa-Politik mit einer beispiellosen Verschuldung? Eine solche Neutralität wird freilich nicht viel wert sein und bietet auch bestimmt keinen besonderen Schutz. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es wenig verwunderlich, dass die kleine Partei, deren Vorsitzende sie ist, das Ziel der Vereinigten Staaten von Europa verfolgt. Wenn ich das Wort „Neutralität“ verwende, meine ich offenbar eine ganz andere Neutralität: jene, die in unserer Verfassung verankert ist, die vom überwiegenden Teil der Bevölkerung hochgehalten wird, der jeder Politiker – egal, welcher Partei – vollinhaltlich verpflichtet ist und zu der lt. Verfassung auch eine umfassende Landesverteidigung (etwa wie in der Schweiz) gehört. Eine Neutralität, die den Weg der Diplomatie auch dann noch ermöglicht, wenn andere Staaten sich längst vom Kriegsgegner zur Kriegspartei entwickelt haben. Eine solche Neutralität, die dem auch gerecht wird, hätte uns ganz gewiss geschützt. Leider haben wir uns davon aber zu weit entfernt. Ob die längst überfällige Kurskorrektur mit einem Außenministerium gelingt, das vor allem eigene Partei- und Europa-Interessen vertritt? Ich glaube nicht. Um mich nicht falsch zu verstehen: Wenn man sich Sorgen um den zunehmenden Werteverlust innerhalb der sog. „Wertegemeinschaft“ macht, ist man nicht automatisch Nationalist, sondern vielleicht einfach nur jemand, der sich einer Werteordnung bewusst ist, die er – wie viele in diesem Land – akut in Gefahr sieht.

camera.org,right,CAMERA,"The Media is Hiding the Truth About the Georgetown Hamasniks The arrest, detention, and pending deportation of Badar Khan Suri, an “academic” at Georgetown University, illuminate a disturbing reality about modern society. No, not about U.S. immigration policy. Rather, the situation is exposing the mainstream media’s extraordinary failure to perform basic journalism. The Washington Post Goes for Broke The Washington Post has found itself making the news more often than its been breaking stories. The once venerable newspaper has been bleeding staff and subscribers. But its failures aren't easily fixed. ABC Reports As Fact Disputed Allegation of Deadly Israeli Strike on UN Facility Without qualifying the claim as a disputed allegation, ABC's Nadine El-Bawab states as fact that Israel hit a U.N. facility in Deir Al-Balah, killing a U.N. worker. But Israel's military said it had not operated in that area. Scrolling Isn’t Reporting: When Journalists Amplify Social Media Disinformation When bad-faith actors use social media as an accelerant for anti-Israel disinformation, the news media too often fans the flames instead of stopping the spread. AFP Corrects: Hamas Authorities Claim 436 Killed in Two Days, Not 970 CAMERA's Israel office has prompted Agence France Presse corrections in both English and French after the news agency grossly inflated Hamas' own claim about the death toll in the Gaza Strip from 436 to 970. Politico Runs Cover for Hamasniks at Georgetown In an article on the arrest of the pro-terror husband of a Hamas-affiliated student at Georgetown, Politico sounds less like a news agency and more like a public relations firm. Unfortunately for Politico, that omitted context came from research produced by CAMERA. CBS Corrects After Underreporting ‘Roughly 100’ Hostages Kidnapped On Oct. 7 CAMERA prompts correction at CBS after the network grossly underreported the number of hostages kidnapped Oct. 7 as ""roughly 100."" Hamas and other terrorists kidnapped 251 hostages on Oct. 7. Mahmoud Khalil: What the Media Isn’t Telling You The case of Mahmoud Khalil has been the talk of the nation’s media in recent days. Predictably, coverage has been short on context but tall on editorializing platitudes. One Step Forward, One Step Back at Rolling Stone The music magazine has improved its reporting on Gaza casualties, but its account of recent events at Columbia University quotes four anti-Israel students and no pro-Israel students. Reuters’ Pro-Houthi Propaganda Video Erases Terror Group’s Foundational Motto Erasing the Houthis' foundational call of ""Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews,"" Reuters recasts the designated terror group as a movement representing a persecuted minority fighting for its (unspecified) interests. New York Times, Haaretz Correct on Israel’s Electricity Cut to the Gaza Strip CAMERA prompts New York Times and Haaretz corrections after both media outlets wrongly reported that Israel's decision to cut electricity to the Gaza Strip impacted a wastewater treatment plant. In fact, the lone affected facility was a desalination plant. United Nations Lists Every Combatant As “Civilian” Which armed terror operative does the United Nations mischaracterize as a civilian? All of them. Every single senior Hamas terror leader, Islamic Jihad gunman, and Aqsa Martyrs Brigades IED thrower killed in action since 2008. Timeline: The BBC Gaza Documentary Controversy Media critics reveal that ""Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone"" is essentially a Hamas production, leading to the broadcast's removal, a national outcry and calls for a parliamentary investigation. UPDATED: Reuters Removes Story Which Turned Murdered Civilian into Mossad Spy Officer Reuters' fawning feature starring the mother of a convicted Palestinian prisoner buries the brutal crime of convicted murderer Diaa El Agha and falsely identifies his civilian victim as a Mossad spy agency officer. Rolling Stone: Covering A Year and a Half of War As a music magazine, Rolling Stone has no obligation to cover these events at all. Yet it not only chooses to do so, it chooses to do it in a manner that misinforms and misleads its readers. This is the last of a three-part series. Rolling Stone: Covering A Year and a Half of War Further sanitizing Hamas’s actions: This is the second of a three-part series examining Rolling Stone’s coverage of the war in Gaza that started on October 7, 2023. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Press Must Note the Red Cross’s Failures The ICRC has failed in its mission to ensure the safety and well being of hostages in Gaza. As CAMERA tells the Washington Times, the Red Cross's failures are conspicuous, and there must be a reckoning. Los Angeles Times Falsely Claims All 1948 Palestinian Arab Refugees Were Expelled The Los Angeles Times falsely reports that ""750,000 Palestinians were expelled"" in 1948, ignoring that the vast majority of the Palestinian Arab refugees fled in 1948 of their own accord, often at the behest of their leadership. Reuters Corrects: War Started With Hamas Attack, Did Not Begin In Gaza Strip CAMERA again prompts a Reuters correction after the wire service erased the Oct. 7 massacre, inventing that the Israel-Hamas war started in the Gaza Strip. In fact, it began with Hamas' devastating invasion of southern Israel, unleashing an orgy of murder, kidnapping, rape, mutilations and torture. Rolling Stone: Covering a Year and a Half of War Creating a narrative, absolving Hamas: This is the first of a three-part series examining Rolling Stone’s coverage of the war in Gaza that started on October 7, 2023. UPDATED: LA Times Corrects: Most Remaining Hostages Are Civilians, Not Soldiers UPDATE: After communication from CAMERA staff and members of the public, The Los Angeles Times finally corrects the demonstrably false claim that most of the remaining hostages are soldiers. In fact, the overwhelming majority of those then remaining -- 60 out of 73 -- are civilians. Reuters Corrects Reference to Tel Aviv as Israel’s Capital For at least the fourth time in recent years, CAMERA prompts correction at Reuters after the influential wire service cited Tel Aviv as shorthand for Israel. CAMERA Op-Ed: Georgetown’s Daughter of Hamas Mapheze Ahmad Yousef Saleh is as a graduate student at Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS). She also happens to be the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, who served as a top adviser for the terrorist organization Hamas under Ismail Haniyeh’s leadership. In fact, Mapheze herself has worked for the designated terrorist organization. Dozens of Corrections Published After AP Erases Convicted Prisoner’s Deadly Crime CAMERA prompts correction of an AP article which had erased the deadly crime of released Palestinian prisoner Imad Abu Aliya. Nearly 50 secondary media outlets also corrected, clarifying that the terrorist was convicted for intentional manslaughter and incitement, not simply affiliation with Hamas. PRESS RELEASE: U.S. Taxpayer-Funded Alhurra Undergoes Overhaul After Platforming Terrorists Alhurra, the U.S. government-funded Arabic-language network, has announced that it will work with CAMERA to improve its journalistic practices and coverage of critical Middle East issues. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post is Dead Set on Trusting Terrorists As CAMERA tells the Algemeiner, were he alive today, George Orwell would have a field day with the Washington Post's coverage of Israel. In their latest effort, the newspaper treats a designated terrorist entity as a credible source. CBS Corrects: Released Hostage Arbel Yahoud Is Not a Soldier CBS commendably corrects after wrongly referring to released hostage Arbel Yahoud, 29, as a soldier. The network has yet to correct its false reference to Kibbutz Kfar Aza as a 'settlement.' Local News Outlets Feature Antisemitic Cartoon Jeff Danziger's cartoon trivialized the plight of Israeli hostages and promoted antisemitic tropes of Israeli bloodlust. CAMERA Op-Ed: Ceasefire Coverage Exculpates Hardcore Terrorists and Murderers Using the current Israel-Hamas ceasefire as their cue to place Palestinian terrorists on equal footing as innocent Israeli hostages, some underperforming journalists are sanitizing the bloody records of hardcore terrorists. Husam Zomlot Promotes Genocide Libel on Amanpour Amanpour covered for Zomlot when he admitted his real goal, that is, he said, ""Israel has got to go."" New Year, New Washington Post? The Washington Post had a terrible 2024, with declining readership, layoffs, and a staff exodus. A look at the newspaper's coverage of the latest Israel-Hamas ceasefire, replete with bias and omissions, speaks volumes about what's wrong with the Post. CAMERA Op-Ed: CBS Is Determined to Redraw Israel’s Map, Facts Be Damned In falsely labelling Kfar Aza a ""settlement,"" CBS' Errol Barnett adopts anti-Israel jargon signaling that the supposedly illegitimate community should be obliterated. France24’s Gavin Lee, Oct. 7 Denier of the Year Engaging in vile Oct. 7 denial, France24 ""World of the Week"" presenter Gavin Lee said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""is the person who triggered the conflict in the first place,"" as if Hamas' orgy of murder, kinocide, rape, kidnapping, torture and maiming never happened. CAMERA Op-Ed: How the Press Serves Hamas’s War Aims A recent study highlighted how Hamas has been manipulating casualty stats as part of the terror group's effort to win the information battlefield. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, too many press outlets have been willfully, and woefully, duped into broadcasting Hamas propaganda. And they should've known better. CAMERA Op-Ed: Biased Journalism Erases the Hostages There’s more than one way to erase the hostages held by Hamas and other terror groups in the Gaza Strip. The more genteel journalistic erasures exact far greater and lasting damage than the bombastic street displays. NY Times Falsifies Link Between Antisemitic Imam and Terrorist’s Mosque New York Times reporters and editors apparently didn't want readers to know that the man who spewed antisemitism at a Houston mosque was the mosque's imam. The deceived their audience by misrepresenting him as a passing guest. AFP Corrects Regarding Netanyahu Stance on Palestinian Governance in Gaza CAMERA prompts an AFP correction after the wire service misreported that Netanyahu has opposed ""any Palestinian governance in the Gaza Strip."" In fact, the Israeli Prime Minister has called for ""civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel."" Strong Words, Feeble Reporting: “60 Minutes” on U.S. Support For Israel A ""60 Minutes"" segment on Gaza platforming disgruntled former State Department officials was packed with strong words standing in for strong arguments. Blaming Arab terrorism targeting Americans on U.S. support for Israel is nothing more than toxic and tired extremist Arab propaganda. CAMERA Op-Ed: The American Historical Association’s Set of Anti-Israel Lies Napoleon Bonaparte, himself a giant of history, famously remarked that “history is a set of lies agreed upon.” Centuries later, the American Historical Association is on the precipice of taking the French revolutionary’s quip literally. Variety Magazine Promotes Holocaust Inversion and Other Propaganda “From Ground Zero” is a compilation of short films made by people in Gaza since the war started, and chronicles some of the hardships that they face. In discussing the movie, Variety does not mention the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel or the hostages that remain in captivity. CAMERA Report: Ivy League Propaganda – How Brown University Radicalized Students After October 7 Since the end of 2023, the extent of anti-American, anti-Israel, and antisemitic radicalism on college campuses has become an issue of national importance. In Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce has even launched an investigation as “antisemitic mobs rule over so-called elite universities…” How did we get here? A new CAMERA study, “Ivy League Propaganda: How Brown University Radicalized Students After October 7,” helps answer this question. The Man Who Wasn’t There: An Account Of A Fake Witness To The Gaza War The charge by Israel’s enemies that it is committing a genocide against the Palestinians is false, malicious and a complete inversion of the truth. Intelligence expert and MEMRI founder Yigal Carmon debunks the claims of Lee Mordechai, a sanctimonious Israeli who promotes the false charge of an Israeli-perpetrated genocide. Strengthened by Purpose: CAMERA’s Impact in 2024 As we look ahead to 2025, we are more committed than ever to what we believe is a foremost necessity of our time – fighting the battle for truth against lies about Israel and the Jewish people in an increasingly complex and dangerous world. CAMERA Op-Ed: USA Today Network Exports Palestinian Antisemitism Does USA Today Network really want to export the unholy nexus of hate, blame, and violence to communities across America, lending a hand to the most ancient bigotry? AP Clarifies That Houthi Missile Attack On ‘Israeli Military Targets’ Hit School After parroting without question demonstrably false Houthi propaganda about an attack on ""Israeli military targets,"" the Associated Press has commendably clarified that the ballistic missile hit an elementary school. CAMERA Op-Ed: Los Angeles Times Music Critic Hits Wrong Note With Israel A recent LA Times piece by music critic Mark Swed erases the suffering of Israelis, CAMERA's Tamar Sternthal writes in Jewish Journal. Responding to Indiana University Professor Benjamin Robinson’s Attack on a Jewish Student CAMERA stands unreservedly behind Applefield, who is a 2024-25 CAMERA on Campus fellow. We’re proud of her article and of her ability to engage in public dialogue in a civil, fact-based manner. VIDEO: The Amsterdam Pogrom – How Bad Journalism Fueled Lies Last month in Amsterdam, gangs turned a soccer match into a horrifying ""Jew hunt,"" chasing and savagely beating victims. Instead of condemning the violence, some media outlets spread baseless claims to excuse it. What really happened reveals an alarming narrative and the persistence of antisemitism. Watch the full story here. AP Casts Hamas’ Contested Fatality Figures as Fact One day after the publication of yet another detailed study identifying serious flaws and anomalies in Hamas-supplied figures for fatalities incurred in Israel's Gaza Strip offensive, AP ran a headline and article which cited the terror organization's disputed and highly questionable figures as fact without even providing attribution. Manufacturing Intent: Amnesty Flails with Genocide Slur Amnesty International's report must prove Israeli ""intent"" to destroy the population of Gaza, so it flails to misrepresent comments by senior Israeli leaders. In flailing to prove genocide, it merely draws attention to how spectacularly it is failing to prove genocide. Jesus Was a Jew: Correcting the 2024 Christmas Narrative The false narrative invading Christendom and all society during the Christmas season depicts Jesus as a Palestinian. This dangerous doctrine is the latest attempt by anti-Israel activists to divorce Jesus from his Jewishness and undermine Christian support for Israel. The Washington Post Gives Extremists a Hand Extremism is rising in America. And as CAMERA notes, the media has played a key role in its ascent. When they're not employing terror apologists, outlets like the Washington Post are obfuscating for those who deem political violence not only acceptable, but an ideal. The Washington Post Gives Amnesty an Assist In an article about Amnesty accusing Israel of genocide, the Post doesn’t think that “what to know” includes the fact that Amnesty has unilaterally changed the definition of genocide in order to attempt to make it fit the situation in Gaza. The Washington Post Helps Hamas, Again The Washington Post's reporting Israel is driven by a malicious narrative that depicts the Jewish state as uniquely evil. The Post's coverage of the latest war, replete with errors and omissions, offers plenty of examples. CAMERA Op-Ed: Amnesty et al’s Dictionary for Jews The journalists aren’t revealing truths, nor are the activists righting real injustices. Their actions, in redefining words as applied to Jews, reveal their ideological motivations, for which they are willing to alter reality itself. The Real Threat to Academic Freedom at Cornell University Academic freedom is an important value that must be protected. That includes protection against those who would exploit their freedom to undermine academic integrity and the academic freedom of others from within. At Cornell University, that threat is emerging. Radicals Tried and Failed to Expel CAMERA From A Teachers’ Convention A call for book-burning at this year’s National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) annual convention has laid bare a growing effort by anti-Zionist activists to control, by whatever means, the narrative on topics they consider contentious. Press Advisory: Amnesty Set to Launch New Round of Biased Anti-Israel Charges On December 4, the activist organization Amnesty International is set to release a report accusing Israel of committing “genocide.” The charge is not merely false, it is a complete inversion of the truth. It is both baseless and malicious, relying on disinformation and invented legal standards to deny the Jewish state its right to self-defense following Hamas’s genocidal attack on October 7, 2023. CAMERA Op-Ed: The ICC Threatens Both Israel and the U.S. The International Criminal Court has issued warrants for the arrest of Israel's prime minister and former defense minister. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, what start's with Israel doesn't end with Israel, and the ICC poses a threat to the United States too. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Media Misses the Truth About UNRWA The Washington Post and other news outlets reported on Israel's recent decision to ban UNRWA. But as CAMERA tells Providence Magazine, many media agencies aren't providing the full details behind the ban. On Reuters, Reliable News and Carpet Bombing Reuters' blatantly false and uncorrected claim that Israel carpet-bombed Beirut's southern suburbs was just one of several recent assaults against the media outlet’s stated commitment to “unbiased and reliable news.” CAMERA Op-Ed: AP Disguises Incitement As ‘Anti-War’ Protest The Associated Press says it advances the power of facts, CAMERA writes in the Algemeiner. However, the news service's refusal to report pro-Hamas incitement and cloaking support for the terror organization's Oct. 7 attack as ""anti-war"" protest is the latest instance of AP diminishing the power of facts. Media Amplifies “Video” Used to Excuse Amsterdam Violence — Does it Exist? After last week’s “Jew hunt” in Amsterdam, anti-Israel activists rushed to excuse the brutal assaults. If Israelis and Jews across the city were beaten down and kicked while lying defenseless and unconscious, the focus, they insisted, should be on Jewish behavior. The media soon joined in. CAMERA Op-Ed: How the Washington Post Helps Hamas Hamas is counting on the Washington Post. As CAMERA tells Washington Examiner magazine, both Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the press for their own ends, using them in their war against the Jewish state. And too often, the media is happy to help. PBS Newshour Doubles Down on Inaccurate Reporting about Israel Correspondent Nick Schifrin inaccurately characterized the IPC Famine Review Committee statement, which by its own terms, did not “declare,” but rather “assumed” that starvation is rapidly increasing in Gaza, and allowed his guest to falsely claim that Israel is “carpet-bombing” Gaza. CAMERA’s Response to Defamatory Petition Aiming to Exclude Us from National Education Convention A petition aiming to expel CAMERA from the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) convention is based on misleading claims and seeks to silence Jewish perspectives in education. CAMERA responds, standing firm in its commitment to promoting accurate, inclusive resources for educators. CAMERA Op-Ed: AP’s Twisted Tale of Professional Malpractice How does Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta's call for regional war square with his reported concern about war's toll on children and why does AP's Abby Sewell conceal his war-mongering sentiment, CAMERA asks in Israel Hayom. CAMERA Op-Ed: What the Amsterdam Pogrom Tells Us In Amsterdam, dozens of Israeli soccer fans were assaulted in part of a coordinated antisemitic attack. As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner: in Europe, pogroms are back. And that tells us quite a lot—and none of it is good. Deutsche Welle Corrects Misreporting on UN’s Partial Findings Regarding Gaza Fatalities Deutsche Welle is the second media outlet in days to correct a headline which had miscast a newly-released misleading and partial UN figure for women and children killed in Gaza (nearly 70 percent of the limited ""verified"" pool) as relating to the totality of fatalities during the entire war. Wall Street Journal & The Sentiment Not Reported UPDATE: The Wall Street Journal corrects an Oct. 26 photo caption which had erased the Hebrew message on a Tehran billboard stating: ""Israel should be wiped off the face of the earth and that is just the beginning of the story."" VOA Corrects Headline Miscasting UN’s Partial Findings on Gaza War Dead VOA corrects a headline which had miscast a newly-released misleading and partial UN figure for women and children killed in Gaza (nearly 70 percent of the limited ""verified"" pool) as relating to the totality of fatalities during the entire war. Despite Alleged ‘Significant Flaws,’ AP Shills For Iranian Executioners of Jewish Citizen ""Advancing the power of facts"" is AP's promise and concealing troubling questions about due process in the horrific execution of Arvin Ghahremani is the reality. AP Removes False Reporting That International Law Gives Palestinians ‘Right of Return’ After CAMERA prompts a significant correction of AP's absurd assertion that ""[i]nternational law gives Palestinian refugees and their descendants the right to return to their homes,"" several dozens secondary media outlets correct. Once Again, CNN Hides the Facts on West Bank Violence CNN's Kareem Khadder and Sana Noor Haq’s omissions demonstrate an unmistakable bias. They work to erase the violence of Palestinians while depicting Israelis as needlessly violent and oppressive. For media consumers seeking straightforward and honest reporting, CNN is clearly not the answer. Haaretz: Lies, Lies, and More Lies Against Israel A recent Haaretz piece by Dahlia Scheindlin is a masterclass in projection and omissions, portraying the Jewish state as uniquely evil. But as CAMERA notes the report is riddled with falsehoods and half-truths. AP Upgrades Palestinian ‘Right of Return’ Demand to International Law The so-called ""right of return"" has been a fundamental Palestinian demand ever since the initial effort to eliminate the nascent state of Israel failed 76 years ago, but now AP has upgraded the unfulfilled aspiration into international law. The Few Versus The 1000s: Reuters Underreports Israeli Figure For UNRWA Staffers With Terror Group Membership The IDF said over 450 UNRWA staffers are military operatives in terror organizations. Israel's Foreign Ministry said more than 2000 UNRWA employees belong to terror groups. But Reuters said Israel cited ""a few."" PBS Newshour Makes Inaccurate Claim About International Law Hospitals and other medical facilities lose their protected status when they are used for military or combat purposes. Haaretz Amends After Grossly Overreporting Fatalities in Strike on Nasrallah CAMERA prompts corrections in both English and Hebrew after Haaretz wrongly reported that Israeli defense officials had estimated that 300 were killed in the Israeli airstrike which targeted Hassan Nasrallah. In fact, an early Israeli estimated cited 300 casualties (not fatalities) and Lebanese officials cited six fatalities. CAMERA Op-Ed: The End of Yahya Sinwar Yahya Sinwar is dead. In the pages of the Washington Examiner, CAMERA explains what the death of the terrorist leader means for both Israel and Hamas. CNN Breaks its Credibility Over Breaking the Silence Allegations Once again, CNN journalists make – in their own words – a horrific allegation against Israeli soldiers. Predictably, the allegation – that Israeli soldiers are using Palestinians as human shields – is short on credible evidence. Instead of acting like professional journalists, the authors act as partisan activists like the ones making the accusation. The Dangerous Misinformation of Propagandist Doctors Some of the most dangerous actors engaged in Hamas’ cynical propaganda campaign come from the ranks of medical professionals who have entered the Gaza war zone to care for the injured and sick. Meet Mark Perlmutter, an anti-Israel activist who uses his medical credentials and Jewish connection (a Jewish father) to propagandize against Israel. In NY Times, Doctors With Credibility Issues Some of the healthcare professionals quoted in a recent New York Times essay have a history of dishonest activism. CNN Journalists Erase Israel’s Enemies and their Crimes Whether writing about 1948 or 2024, some CNN journalists have a hard time acknowledging Palestinian and Arab aggression against Israel. Perhaps it’s because they aren’t interested in reporting the truth. Perhaps they’re simply interested in advancing a partisan narrative. CNN Uncritically Amplifies a Kangaroo Court Merriam-Webster defines the term “kangaroo court” as “a mock court in which the principles of law and justice are disregarded or perverted.” There is no more apt term for the United Nations’s Commission of Inquiry (COI) against Israel, which has long dispensed with any pretense of being fair, impartial, or objective. So why did CNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Muhammad Darwish treat the COI as if its conclusions carried any respectability? CAMERA Op-Ed: The Future of the Middle East, One Year After October 7 Israel has experienced impressive victories against Iranian proxies. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, a larger war, directly between Tehran and Jerusalem, is coming into focus. CAMERA Op-Ed: Who Was Hassan Nasrallah? After he was killed in an IDF strike, several media commentators offered fawning obituaries of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. But as CAMERA told the Washington Examiner magazine, Nasrallah was a butcher, a murderer who was good at organizing and leading other murderers. Double Standards at CBS CBS Gaza-based producer Marwan Al-Ghoul has been feted by colleagues for his coverage of Israel’s war against Hamas since October 7. Yet his social media is full of horrific antisemitism and praise for terrorism. At the same time, CBS anchor Tony Dokoupil has been rebuked for pointing out that an author's expressed views on Israel are extreme and omit essential context. What does that say about CBS? On Atonement and False Charges of Israeli Genocide In the LA Times, Rabbi Aryeh Cohen castigates the alleged sins of the American Jewish community for ""indiscriminately support[ing] the state of Israel, even though in January the International Court of Justice found it plausible that the Israeli government was committing genocide."" In fact, that the ICJ in no way determined that Israel is plausibly committing genocide. NY Times Forgets: UN Resolution Calls for Disarming of Hezbollah Although United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 calls for the disarming of Hezbollah through Lebanon, the New York Times misinforms readers by citing only the part of the resolution calling on the terror group to evacuate southern Lebanon. The Washington Post Gets Lost in Lebanon The Washington Post is lost in Lebanon. The newspaper's coverage of Israel's recent incursion into Lebanon is rife with errors of omission and misleading misrepresentations. A recent report offers a good example. CNN Hides Iran’s Genocidal Ambitions As Iran and its terrorist proxies wage war against the Jewish state, CNN owes its audience the truth about Iran’s goal: the destruction of the Jewish state. This is especially so when Iran itself states it publicly. The Bloomberg Way? News Analysis Disguised As News Claims Iran Had No Choice In a news analysis passed off as news, Bloomberg argues that Iran had no choice but to respond to ""sustained Israeli escalation,"" ignoring the escalation of Iranian proxies and Iran's genocidal nuclear aspirations to wipe Israel off the map. The New York Times Balances, Slants on Oct. 7 Anniversary Even as the New York Times carefully balanced its coverage on the anniversary of a one-sided massacre, a familiar slant is evident. NPR Corrects on Strikes Against Hezbollah CAMERA told NPR editors that, contrary to their headline, both Israel and the Lebanese citizens heard from in the segment refer to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, not strikes ""targeting civilians."" CAMERA Op-Ed: The Future of Hezbollah Israel has severely degraded Hezbollah, taking out the group's top leaders and operatives. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the terrorist organization will remain a threat for the foreseeable future. Double Erasure: AP, Campus Free Speech & The Banishment of Jewish Students The banishment of Jewish students from campus spaces clearly impedes their free speech, yet AP's article supposedly covering the chilling of campus free speech said not one word about this dark phenomenon. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Authors of Lebanon’s Disaster A large scale conflict between Israel and Hezbollah would likely result in a substantial loss of life. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Times, a full-scale war could have been averted if only the UN and the Lebanese Armed Forces had done their jobs. They haven't. Attempts to Erase Nasrallah’s Antisemitism Anti-Israel terror groups reliably have their apologists. And so doubts have been raised about whether Nasrallah really made two antisemitic statements. He did. CNN Sanitizes Antisemitic Terrorism Until CNN is honest about the genocidal crusade of Iran and its proxy terrorist groups, the network’s audience will fail to comprehend the motivations of the parties to the conflict. One side seeks to erase the Jewish state from existence, while the other side refuses to lie down and die. What the Nasrallah Obits Omit Some do a better job at informing readers of Nasrallah’s reign of terror and destruction, others do worse, but few are as egregiously distorted as CNN's obituary. Los Angeles Times Corrects: No Evidence That Ordinary Lebanese Citizens Bought Exploding Pagers CAMERA's Israel office yesterday prompts correction of a Los Angeles Times letter-to-the-editor which fabricated that Lebanese civilians not affiliated with Hezbollah had purchased the exploding pagers. CAMERA Op-Ed: Hezbollah’s Media Strategy Hezbollah has an ace up its sleeve. As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the terrorist group is counting on the press for help in their war against Israel. Latest Report on BBC Coverage of Israel-Hamas War Highlights Old Problems, Raises New Concerns For the BBC to regain public trust, an independent inquiry into its adherence to editorial standards of accuracy and impartiality in its coverage of Israel and Jewish affairs is crucial. CAMERA Op-Ed: Land Swaps Won’t Deter Hezbollah As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner: history is clear, land swaps don't appease Islamist terrorists. Rather, they embolden them. And the reason is simple: Hezbollah wants more than mere parcels of land, it wants Israel's destruction CAMERA Op-Ed: International Law Association Prioritizes Anti-Israel Propaganda over Debate Developing the ability to engage in vigorous debate and oppositional advocacy is central to legal education. So why is the American Branch of the International Law Association (ABILA) so averse to a diversity of opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? NY Times Report on Iran’s Proxies Embraces Their Narrative Iran and its proxies are likely to appreciate a New York Times report on Iran and its proxies, since it embraces the language of the terrorists axis of resistance. As Ta-Nehisi Coates Jumps on the Anti-Israel Bandwagon, New York Magazine Writes Glowing Profile The profile showcases Coates’s apparent blindness to any facts that don’t support his anti-Israel premise, and his desire for Jews to return to statelessness and powerlessness. After Pager Attack, Journalists and Activists Obfuscate for Hezbollah But they are also aimed at history. If factual news reports on the pager and walkie-talkie attacks are the first rough draft of history, then revisionism by less scrupulous journalists are a malicious attempt at a second draft. AP Improves Coverage After Downplaying Hezbollah Attacks on Israeli Civilians, Obscuring Terrorist Fatalities AP's initial misreporting downplayed Hezbollah attacks targeting Israeli civilians and also obscured Hezbollah losses. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis sought shelter from Hezbollah attacks, not thousands. Previous Hezbollah barrages did not mainly aim at military targets. And Hezbollah lost 16 top members -- not just one -- in Friday's Beirut strike. NYT Covers for Oct 7 Massacre Participants One allegation. One U.N. investigation into the allegation. But when the allegation goes into the magician’s hat, an altogether separate investigation gets pulled out. It might not be magic. But it’s certainly not journalism of the “highest possible standards.” NPR Reporting on Pager Attack Omits Crucial Background Information As the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah escalates, it’s important that tax-payer funded NPR be clear in every report not only about who the aggressor is, but also who exactly Hezbollah is. On the Moral Confusion of the Jewish Chronicle’s Jewish Critics Jewish writers more troubled by a mainstream, pro-Israel British Jewish publication than a global media institution notorious for its pathological hostility to the Jewish state and willingness to trade in anti-Jewish tropes have forfeited the moral high ground. AP, Los Angeles Times Falsely Report Activist Rachel Corrie Was Trying to Block Home Demolition The Associated Press and Los Angeles Times neglect to correct erroneous reporting that U.S. activist Rachel Corrie was killed while she was protesting a home demolition in the Gaza Strip. Court documents show the bulldozer was clearing brush used in attacks against troops. CBS News stands out, stands by false Hamas figures When Hamas halved its casualty figures following an Israeli strike on three of its senior leaders most major media outlets followed suit. But CBS News chose to leave readers in the dark. Rapporteurs Without Principles: Francesca Albanese Francesca Albanese, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, bangs the table as she misrepresents the facts. AFP Repackages Hamas-Supplied Casualty Figures As Independent U.N. Data In its latest fib about Gaza's fatalities, AFP's farcically attributes Hamas data to the United Nations, laundering the terror organization's numbers as independent and credible. The Asserson Report: The Israel-Hamas war and the BBC CAMERA UK and CAMERA Arabic are delighted to have contributed to The Asserson Report, a seminal study exposing BBC's deeply biased coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Jerusalem Post Corrects: Rachel Corrie Wasn’t Preventing A Home Demolition CAMERA prompts correction of a Jerusalem Post article claiming that U.S. activist Rachel Corrie was killed 2003 in the Gaza Strip while preventing a home demolition. A Haifa court found that the bulldozer was clearing brush to prevent attacks on Israeli troops. The Washington Post: Murdering Jews is ‘Armed Resistance’ A recent Washington Post report calls terrorism merely “armed resistance,” echoing language used by Hamas and its apologists. Further, the Post inaccurately claims that Palestinian terrorism didn't exist until Israel was recreated in 1948, a lie that shows how ill-informed and malicious the newspaper is. Reuters Underreports Israeli Fatalities in Palestinian, Hezbollah Attacks UPDATE: CAMERA prompts correction after Reuters' James Mackenzie and Ali Sawafta significantly understate the number of Israeli and foreigners killed in Palestinian and Hezbollah attacks. Bloomberg: Ceasefire Deal To Exchange Hostages, Palestinian ‘Political Prisoners’ Bloomberg's Joumanna Bercetche erroneously reports that a ceasefire deal would see ""the exchange of hostages and Palestinian political prisoners."" Imprisoned Palestinians potentially to be freed are all affiliated with designated terror organizations and/or engaged in terror activity. None are in jail due to protected political activity. BDS Lies: Exposing 45 False Claims in the Brown University Divestment Proposal CAMERA joined with several Brown University alumni to put together a submission in opposition to divestment. The submission, delivered on August 30, identifies a total of 45 false claims made in BDC’s proposal, debunking each in turn. Reuters Amends Bogus Quote Which Echoed Hamas Lie That Ben-Gvir Released Plans for Temple Mount Synagogue CAMERA prompts correction of an egregious bogus quote at Reuters echoing Hamas' false claim that Itamar Ben-Gvir announced plans for a Temple Mount synagogue. But the news agency has yet to correct the inflammatory falsehood that the far-right Israeli minister called for Jewish prayer in the Al-Aqsa mosque. AFP Corrects: Rashida Tlaib Isn’t First Palestinian-American in Congress CAMERA prompts correction of an Agence France Presse article which incorrectly identified Rep. Rashida Tlaib as “the first Palestinian-American in Congress."" While she is the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, several Palestinian-American men served preceded her. Jerusalem Post Corrects ‘Palestine’ Terminology CAMERA prompts corrections at The Jerusalem Post following the newspaper's erroneous use of the term ""Palestine"" to refer to a present-day entity. Press Release: More Than 80 North American Media Outlets Correct After AP Outflanks Hamas Casualty Claims CAMERA’s intervention prompts a sweeping correction from the Associated Press, leading over 80 media outlets to retract an inflated Gaza death toll figure. More Than 80 Media Outlets Correct AP’s False Claim That Gaza’s Civilian Deaths Exceed 40,000 More than 80 North American news outlets publish an Associated Press correction prompted by CAMERA after the wire service falsely reported that the civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip has exceeded 40,000. The scores of corrections are the most that CAMERA has prompted at once from a single wire service story. The Washington Post, BDS, and ‘Blank Page Journalism’ A recent Washington Post report on efforts to boycott American companies for their ostensible support of Israel is so replete with falsehoods, misleading omissions, and terrorist propaganda that discerning readers would be better off if it were a blank page. Forbes’ Al Aqsa Libel: Ben-Gvir, 100s of Jewish Israelis ‘Enter’ Mosque Channeling the Qatari-run Al Jazeera and the government-controlled Turkish Anadolu Agency, Forbes falsely reports that Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir and hundreds joining him entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. UPI, McClatchy Remove Erroneous References to Hostages as ‘Prisoners’ In response to communication from CAMERA, UPI and McClatchy commendably remove an erroneous reference to hostages held in captivity in the Gaza Strip as ""prisoners."" The hostages have not committed crimes, are not being held lawfully, and are not awaiting trial. Avi Shlaim Falsifies Iraqi Jewish History In his memoirs, historian Avi Shlaim joins those who blame Zionists for the dissolution of the Iraq's Jewish community — ignoring, obscuring, and outright falsifying facts to promote the untenable thesis. NY Times’ Great Insight: ‘Some Trucks’ Carrying Food Enter Gaza After reporting the fiction of ""Israel's blanket blockade of food"" entering Gaza, The New York Times' correction conceals the huge quantity of food which has entered the territory, citing ""some trucks"" as opposed to an actual sum. Since its Botched Al-Ahli Hospital Coverage, CNN Has Only Gotten Worse CNN clearly understands that bad journalism not only does a disservice to its audience, but it also puts innocent civilians in danger. So, what are we to make of the fact that these reporters are knowingly repeating the same mistakes? AP Adrift: The Houthis’ Maritime ‘Retaliation’ & Hamas’ ‘Relative Moderate’ Unmoored from facts, AP terms Houthi attacks on international commercial ships as ""retaliation"" for Israel's war against Hamas, labels Ismail Haniyah a ""relative moderate,"" and affords Hamas more credibility than Israel. PBS Relocates Holon Stabbing Attack Into West Bank In her Aug. 4 PBS Weekend News broadcast, Laura Barrón-López misidentified Holon, the site in central Israel of a deadly stabbing attack, as located within the West Bank. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Post-Political Lives of Anti-Israel Politicians Jamaal Bowman, the anti-Israel Congressman from New York's 16th Congressional District, has lost his primary fight. Leading news outlets like POLITICO echoed claims that Bowman's loss was due to the influence of the pro-Israel lobby. But as CAMERA tells Washington Examiner Magazine, the truth is otherwise, and Bowman is just one in a long line of anti-Israel politicians to blame AIPAC for his electoral loss. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Long History of Palestinian Rejectionism Israel needs to embrace victory and cease its decades long failed strategy of conciliation. So argues Daniel Pipes in his latest book. CAMERA reviews the book for the Washington Free Beacon. CNN: Journalism in Service of Hamas War Crimes CNN’s coverage portrays three separate standards in the law of armed conflict: a unique, higher standard applied to the Jewish state; the standard applied to the rest of the world; and no standard to Palestinian terrorists who seek to wipe the Jewish state from the face of the earth. Bad Actors and Willing Dupes in Hamas’ Propaganda War Hamas' propaganda war to cast the Jewish state as genocidal is carried out with the engagement of bad actors, including health workers, and willing dupes from the mainstream media. John Oliver’s Latest Rant About Israel Is As Misinformed As It Is Crass Oliver has told only half the story, and his cherry-picked facts, or in some cases outright falsehoods, are designed to lead his viewers to specific conclusions. Hamas’s Haniyeh: The Media’s “Moderate” Murderer? The word ""moderate"" doesn't belong near the name Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the extremist terror group Hamas. If there are Hamas officials who are even more extreme than him, then he is at best less extreme, but still extreme. Hezbollah Massacres Children and the Washington Post Blames Israel Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based U.S.-designated terror group, has murdered a dozen Druze children and wounded dozens more in northern Israel. But the Washington Post chooses to devote front-page coverage to Israel's response, while providing Hezbollah with cover. The New Wall Street Journal – Chasing Clicks with Anti-Israel Bias The growing, undeniable tilt against Israel in Wall Street Journal news coverage since the October 7 Hamas attack on the Jewish state appears connected to a change in focus under a new Editor-in-Chief, Emma Tucker. The Journal now routinely terms all of the West Bank ""Palestinian territory"" -- an error previously corrected in the Journal's own pages. ABC Invents: Netanyahu Has ‘So Far Rejected’ Biden’s Ceasefire Proposal The flip side of widespread false reporting last May that Hamas accepted the ceasefire proposal on the table, ABC fabricates that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far rejected President Biden's plan. AP Cites ‘Military Action’ In Deadly School Strike, Ignores Errant Hamas Rockets The Associated Press swerves and ducks the facts about lives cut short by Hamas — Palestinians sheltering in schools killed by errant Hamas rockets along with Israeli babies murdered on Oct. 7. The Washington Post Attacks Victims of Hamas, Again The Washington Post recently attacked the parents of Omer Neutra, an American-born IDF tank commander who was taken hostage on October 7th. But its not the first time that the failing newspaper has attacked victims of Hamas. How AFP Is Disrupting the World of Information Israel is the primary obstacle to Palestinian unity, reports AFP, ignoring that Hamas is a terror organization. From Gaza's civilian casualties and food shortages in the north to the Temple Mount's status in Judaism, the wire service fails to safeguard its charter calling for accuracy and impartiality. CAMERA Op-Ed: Israel’s Message to Hezbollah Israel has reportedly taken out a mid-level Hezbollah operative in Syria. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the strike is a message to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah: escalate at your own risk. How Extremism is Being Exported from Ramallah to American Campuses “We find Harvard’s relationship with Birzeit University…to be extremely concerning,” reads a July 15 letter sent by nearly thirty members of Congress to Harvard University’s Interim President Alan Garber. Wait until Congress hears about Birzeit’s relationship with another Ivy League institution, Brown University. CNN Continues to Advocate for US Sanctions on Israel In both televised and print reports, Katie Polglase advocates for sanctions on Israel. The televised segment also contained an echo of an ancient antisemitic stereotype. CNN Hides a Chief Terrorist Far too many of the network’s reporters are more interested in reporting a narrative of the conflict, rather than the reality. The Bias of Meta’s Oversight Board The Board’s questionable handling of the public engagement process over moderating the term ""shaheed"" does not inspire confidence that these issues are being fairly or fully considered. With upcoming Board recommendations on moderating the phrase “from the river to the sea” and how to handle the use of the term “Zionists” when compared to criminality, it is clear that the Board seeks to have an enormous influence on online expression relating to Israel and antisemitism. As antisemitism and anti-Israel extremism surge, this should be concerning to all. Shape Online Conversations – Join Our Team!

We are looking for a dynamic and experienced professional to help shape online conversations and promote accurate information about the Middle East. Times of Israel Corrects: Abdallah Aljamal, Who Held Israeli Hostages, Was Palestine Chronicle Correspondent Times of Israel corrects after misidentifying Abdallah Aljamal, a Gaza resident who held three Israeli hostages, as a contributor at Palestine Chronicle. In fact, as correspondent, he had a more significant role at the U.S.-based pro-Hamas outlet. CAMERA Op-Ed: The International Court of Justice Never Said That In dozens of stories, AP committed one of the most egregious journalistic transgressions: misattributing a false quote to a source. Tamar Sternthal explains in Times of Israel how a bogus ICJ quote alleging “plausible risk of genocide” in Gaza found its way into AP reporting, and how CAMERA put an end to it. Christiane Amanpour Wants to Know, What Does Israel Fear From Palestine? The CNN anchor invited propagandist Raja Shehadeh to her show, but he didn't honestly answer the question, instead engaging in the manipulative tactic of reversing victim and offender. LA Times Falsely Blames Home Sales in ‘Palestinian’ Land for Attacks on LA Jews The Los Angeles Times has found a culprit for the violent attacks targeting Los Angeles Jews outside the Adas Torah Synagogue. And, no, it's not the pro-terror organization which organized the violent synagogue siege. UPDATE: LA Times corrects on 'Palestinian land,' legality of settlements. NY Times Hires Another Anti-Israel Extremist to Cover Israel To help with its coverage of Israel, the New York Times has hired: someone who had praised Hitler; someone who denied Hamas has murdered Israeli civilians; someone who has said her objectivity about Israel was out the window; and now, Bora Erden, another committed anti-Israel activist. CAMERA Op-Ed: Is Hezbollah Using Beirut Airport? A recent report cited unnamed sources who claimed that Hezbollah is using Beirut airport to store weapons. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner there’s a long history of Hezbollah using ports of entry to store weapons. CAMERA Op-Ed: Israel at a Crossroads Israel, Michael Horowitz argues in his new book, is at a crossroads. The Jewish state faces a mounting threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran yet it also enjoys warming relations with many Arab nations. As CAMERA tells the Washington Free Beacon, Horowitz makes excellent points but also omits key context. CNN (Sort Of) Corrects On Use Of 2,000 Pound Bomb After a vague ""clarification,"" the article is still misleading as to the frequency of the use of this weapon. Military expert John Spencer called it ""a very commonly used tool."" CAMERA Op-Ed: Al Jazeera on the Potomac The Washington Post is bleeding money and losing subscribers at an astonishing rate. The Post is turning to new leaders, and new programs, to recoup their losses. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner magazine, it is the newspaper's failure to abide by basic journalism standards that are the chief contributing factor. CNN Article Breathes False Life into the Gaza “Famine” Lie Is there an imminent famine in Gaza? How CNN has covered this story over the last four months is illuminating, but not in the sense of discovering the facts. Rather, CNN’s coverage illustrates how the network is leaving its audience both uninformed and misinformed. Diplomatic Controversies and Lazy ‘Journalism’ at CNN CNN authors found it sufficient to largely copy and paste from competing statements without adding any value. To call this lazy journalism isn’t entirely accurate, though. After all, we know that the network will work overtime to concoct bizarre “investigative” reporting riddled with holes, dubious claims, and thin evidence. The amount of effort devoted seems to depend on who the story makes look good or bad. MSNBC Mislabels Northern Israeli Communities ‘Settlements’ On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Keir Simmons erroneously referred to locations which Hezbollah targeted within internationally-recognized Israeli territory as ""settlements."" While MSNBC agreed the terminology was wrong, the network declined to broadcast a correction. Hamas Gambled on Biased Western Journalism. CNN Played Right Into It. A Hamas leader admitted to deliberately engaging in war crimes as a matter of strategy and CNN’s Nic Robertson still made it instead about Israel being bad. UPI Corrects After Inflating UN Data on Palestinians Killed by Settlers CAMERA prompts correction after UPI falsely reported that United Nations said ""nearly 500"" West Bank Palestinians were killed in settler-related incidents since Oct. 7. In fact, the UN cited seven fatalities. McClatchy subsequently corrects on more than two dozen sites. Scrubbed by the Times: NY Times Routinely Erases Extremism from “Pro-Palestinian Protests” Four times this week, the New York Times covered anti-Israel demonstrations and incidents. Each time, it concealed from readers vile extremism, death threats, support for Hamas and its Oct. 7 attacks, and violent assaults by those the paper characterizes as ""pro-Palestinian protesters."" Reuters Deletes Social Media Posts Citing ‘Tel Aviv’ As Shorthand for Israel In response to communication from CAMERA's Jerusalem office, Reuters deletes posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook which erroneously used Tel Aviv as a metonyn for Israel. Whitewashing Red Triangles: AP Scrubs Pro-Hamas Graffiti Even as authorities from Sydney to Brooklyn were still investigating and removing pro-Hamas graffiti, the Associated Press engaged in scrubbing of a different sort. CAMERA Prompts NY Times to Amend Ceasefire Misrepresentation The New York Times had erred on the basics of a ceasefire proposal. CAMERA's outreach prompted the paper to amend its language. The University of Minnesota’s Cynical Holocaust Studies Hire The University of Minnesota is set to hire, as its new director for the Center for Holocaust & Genocide Studies, an individual who would serve better as a case study on the persistence of genocidal antisemitism than as credible researcher of it. ‘Blatant Lie’: Haaretz Adds IDF’s Response to Hamas Claim That Hostages Were Killed In Rescue Operation Haaretz had initially reported Hamas' unsubstantiated claim that Israeli hostages were killed during the successful June 8 rescue operation without noting the IDF denial. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Rise of Anti-Zionist Networks in the U.S. A recent New York Post report noted the anti-Israel activism of Theodore Roosevelt's great-great-great grandson. But as CAMERA tells the Algemeiner, it's all in the family. Roosevelt's grandchildren, both CIA officers, helped establish anti-Zionist networks in the U.S., and they used government funds to do so. Arrested Truth: UPI Cites As Fact Disputed Figures For West Bank Arrests UPI reports as fact a Palestinian organization's dubious claim that nearly 9000 West Bank Palestinians have been arrested since Oct. 7, ignoring Israel's figure of less than half that number. Once again, McClatchy pulls Adam Schrader's deeply flawed article from all of its sites. CNN’s Advocacy Journalism CNN appears to be advocating for a further US arms embargo on Israel in a pair of articles masquerading as journalism. NY Times Misleads on Rafah Crossing and Rafah Ruling Israel shut down the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. So said the New York Times. No one of consequence denies the World Court called for an end to Israeli military operations in Rafah. So argued the New York Times. In both cases, the news was false — as reporting even in the New York Times would eventually make clear. CAMERA Op-Ed: The United Nations Helps Hamas The United Nations is a key component in Hamas's war to destroy the Jewish state. And as CAMERA tells the Washington Times, the UN provides cover for the terrorist group. The press should not grant the UN undue credibility. Al Hurra Clarifies About Hamas’ False Claim To Accept Ceasefire After Al Hurra repeatedly reported as fact Hamas' claim that it accepted a ceasefire proposal, CAMERA prompts the publicly-funded American Arabic-language network to add the State Department's unequivocal response: ""Hamas did not accept a ceasefire proposal."" The Washington Post Makes Hamas Claims Appear and Disappear The Washington Post continues to uncritically regurgitate claims from Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. This has led to numerous embarrassing moments. Recently, the newspaper chose to delete an entire story that was entirely based on Hamas sources Times of Israel Corrects AP’s Tel Aviv Metonym for Israel UPDATE: In response to communication from CAMERA, both TIME and Times of Israel correct Associated Press copy which erroneously cited Tel Aviv as shorthand for Israel. Both media outlets now correctly refer to Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Fifty-Two UN “Experts” and Seven Major Lies Fifty-two UN experts either didn’t bother to fact check their own statement or had no qualms about spreading lies about the Jewish state in order to accuse it of all manner of evils. Haaretz Corrects: Israeli Airstrike Did Not Hit Rafah Encampment In this second correction of an English-language mistranslation this week, Haaretz clarifies in print and online that an Israeli airstrike did not hit the Rafah tent encampment where secondary explosions started a deadly fire. CAMERA Op-ED: Agenda-Free? Bias-Free? AP’s Journalism Deserves Scrutiny From citing unreliable casualty figures to implicitly adopting the Hamas narrative, the news agency has shown an anti-Israel slant, CAMERA's Tamar Sternthal writes in Times of Israel. ‘Gaza Strikes Back’: UPI Hits Rock Bottom ""Gaza strikes back at Israel after enduring months of war"" was the United Press International headline whose relationship to reality mirrors that of George Lucas' ""The Empire Strikes Back"" science fiction favorite. Haaretz Corrects After Reporting That Israel (Not Egypt) Closed Rafah Crossing CAMERA prompts correction after Haaretz erroneously reported in English (and not Hebrew) that Israel closed the Rafah Crossing. Egypt, not Israel, closed the Gaza-Egypt crossing. Fact Checking the ICJ: An Order Based in Omissions and Deceptions In its May 24 order, the International Court of Justice relied on a handful of dubious, generalized and misleading claims made by various United Nations figures. Iraq 2003 and Gaza 2023 Journalists have often contrasted the fighting in Gaza with the American fighting in Iraq. They have often done so misleadingly. We take a closer look. CNN Promotes One-Sided “Nakba” Narrative and Repeats False Claim It Has Already Corrected Three Times CNN has corrected the false claim that, “the International Court of Justice says it’s ‘plausible’ Israel is committing genocide” in Gaza three times already, yet a May 15 article repeats it again. CAMERA Op-Ed: Raisi’s Death Won’t Change Much As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the recent death of Ebrahim Raisi, the president of Iran, in a helicopter crash won’t change much. In the Islamic Republic, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say, and men like Raisi are but his servants. The regime and its ambitions—to destroy Israel and remove the U.S. from the Middle East—will live on. AP Mum on Egypt’s Closure of Crossing, Faulting Israel For Rafah Food Shortages AP conceals that Egypt refuses to coordinate with Israel on the transfer of aid, thereby preventing the passage of food through Rafah crossing into the Gaza Strip. By falsely holding Israel responsible for the reported food shortage, AP piles on to the tampered evidence upon which the ICC has built its whole rotten case. “From the River to the Sea” – CAMERA Weighs in on Meta Moderation Policy The text of CAMERA’s submission to the Meta Oversight Board regarding content moderation policies and the use of the phrase “from the river to the sea.” Los Angeles Times Clarifies: US, Israel Dispute Hamas Claim to Accept Ceasefire CAMERA prompts correction of a Los Angeles Times article which inaccurately reported that ""Hamas had accepted terms of a cease-fire."" As the U.S. State Department made explicitly clear: ""Hamas did not accept a ceasefire proposal."" The Washington Post Reanimates Antisemitism The Washington Post is gaining quite the reputation. Once known for bringing down Presidents, the newspaper has been reduced to repeating Muslim Brotherhood-talking points. NPR Promotes Palestinian Myths to Delegitimize the Jewish State A segment of ""Here & Now,"" produced by NPR affiliate WBUR was devoted entirely to promoting the concept of “Nakba”— “catastrophe”— to describe the establishment of the modern State of Israel. With both host and guest promoting Palestinian foundational myths to delegitimize the Jewish state, the segment sounded more like propaganda on Voice of Al Aqsa, a Hamas radio station, than a report from a U.S. public radio network that claims to adhere to journalistic norms. ICC Prosecutor Seeks to Effectively Rob Israel of its Legitimate Right to Self-Defense Military experts have attested that Israel is taking every possible step to avoid harm to civilians, while conducting a legitimate and necessary war of self-defense. To characterize this as “extermination” or “murder,” and to use it to justify international legal action against Israel's leaders, is to twist morality on its head. Reuters Inflates By Millions 1948 Refugees Who Fled to Jordan Reuters errs that ""Jordan took in millions of Palestinian refugees"" following the 1948 war. But the total number of Palestinian Arab refugees from that war was 700,000, and only about half of them went to Jordan. Hamas Flag Shows Up On NYC Street, But Not in AFP Caption UPDATE: CAMERA prompts corrections of AFP and Getty photograph captions which whitewashed a New York City demonstrator waving a Hamas flag and sporting a Hamas headband as a ""[p]ro-Palestinian"" demonstrator. The corrected captions make his Hamas affiliation clear. CAMERA Op-Ed: Leaving Hamas in Rafah Saves the Terrorist Group As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, Hamas can’t be eliminated unless the IDF launches an operation in Rafah. While some in the U.S. have questioned the wisdom of such a move, allowing Hamas to remain in Rafah effectively preserves the terrorist group. ‘Nakba’ in a Vacuum: AP Covers 1948 ‘Mass Expulsion,’ Erases Arab War of Annihilation AP's selective coverage of the 'Nakba,' the defining event of the Palestinian national struggle, embodies the core fault of international media coverage: erasing Palestinian agency. AP accounts ignore the Arab war to eliminate the nascent Jewish state. CAMERA Op-Ed: Iran’s Unprecedented Attack on Israel As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, Iran’s recent barrage of missiles and drones launched from Iranian soil is unprecedented. The attack marks a significant, and noteworthy, escalation by the Islamic Republic. Failing to respond would hurt Israel’s deterrence—and America’s. CAMERA Op-Ed: Iran Wants to Destroy Israel As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, Israel is not purely at war in Gaza against Hamas. Rather it is at war with the Iranian regime — a war in which Tehran struck a devastating blow. AFP Amends After Reporting Israeli Participation Clouded Whole Eurovision CAMERA prompts AFP to amend after reporting the ""whole [Eurovision] contest has been clouded by the participation of Israel."" It's not Israel which clouded Eurovision. It's the haters of Israel who did so. Blind Acceptance: Media Outlets Take Hamas’ Lying Word On Ceasefire Approval Media outlets uncritically reported as fact Hamas' false claim that the terror organization accepted the Gaza ceasefire proposal, completely ignoring the State Department's unequivocal clarification: ""Hamas did not accept a ceasefire proposal."" CAMERA Op-Ed: Anti-Israel Ideology Tarnishes Brown University Brown University's contribution to a growing trend of antisemitic views among young Americans is notable, not only for the extremist ideology promoted on campus by its Center for Middle East Studies but also because it aims to shape even younger minds through its Choices Program, a social-studies curriculum for high schoolers that includes units informed by the same radical ideology. UPI Belatedly Acknowledges: Hamas Attacked Kerem Shalom Crossing Two days after UPI’s Adam Schrader completely ignored that Hamas fired rockets towards Kerem Shalom even as he blamed Israel exclusively for the humanitarian crises facing Gazans, CAMERA prompts the news agency to cover the terror organization’s deadly attack on the crossing for the first time. NPR’s Pro-Hamas, Anti-Israel Narrative Part II: Producer This is the second of two articles describing how NPR has skewed its coverage of the Hamas-Israel war toward a pro-Hamas, anti-Israel narrative. NPR’s Pro-Hamas, Anti-Israel Narrative Part I: Citations and Interviewees This is the first of two articles describing how NPR has skewed its coverage of the Hamas-Israel war toward a pro-Hamas, anti-Israel narrative. CAMERA Op-Ed: Brown University Sends a Message that Extremism Works As American universities are aflame with extremism, antisemitism, and lawlessness, universities have only themselves to blame for the decades-long promotion of faculty members who abuse their role to indoctrinate students in “resistance”. By rewarding bad behavior over respectful dialogue, they are sowing the seeds of yet more chaos and lawlessness. These News Outlets Spread the “Plausible Genocide” Libel When the International Court of Justice issued an order on January 26 in the “genocide” case between South Africa and Israel, it soon became common knowledge that the ICJ had found it “plausible” that Israel was committing “genocide.” This common knowledge, however, was in fact a myth. Tuvia Grossman Redux: Reuters’ Miscoverage and the Attack on Yoseph Haddad at Columbia University The story which played out last week in Morningside Heights bore an uncanny resemblance to an unforgettable bloody incident which transpired Sept. 29, 2000 in Jerusalem at the outbreak of the Second Intifada. It’s far from clear that journalists have gleaned the necessary lessons from the misreporting of Tuvia Grossman’s ordeal. With Additional WSJ Distortions, List of Manipulated Statistics Grows It’s one thing to compare Israel’s invasion of Gaza in its battle to upend the Hamas regime with the US invasion of Iraq as it fought to overthrow Saddam Hussein. It is another to pretend to do so. CNN Article Errs and Misleads on Gaza Humanitarian Aid A CNN graphic, and the preceding text, suggests that the daily average number of trucks bringing food into Gaza now is less than half of what it was before October 7. In fact, the truth is precisely the opposite. Substantially more trucks are bringing food into Gaza today than were a year ago. CNN’s Latest Wild Accusation: Israel Imposing a “Blockade on Aid” In the world of journalism, there are understandable errors, and then there are the types of errors that make you wonder whether the journalists are living in the same reality. Tucker Carlson’s assault on American Christian support for Israel Under the guise of advocating for Palestinian Christians, Tucker Carlson launched a two-pronged assault on American Christian support for the Jewish State. To provide legitimacy for his campaign, he enlisted the help of Rev. Dr. Munther Isaac, a notorious propagandist for the Palestinian anti-Israel narrative. ABC’s This Week Amplifies Virulently Antisemitic Slur, Rolling Stone Piles On When the World Central Kitchen founder said that Israel is at “war against humanity itself,” both ABC and Rolling Stone thought that repetition of this dehumanizing trope would make a good headline. Unparalleled Intelligence: UPI Claims To Know More Than U.S. on Damascus Strike While U.S. intelligence has yet to determine whether a building attacked in Damascus is an Iranian consular facility, UPI's Adam Schrader knows: Israel ""destroyed Iran's consulate in Damascus."" McClatchy commendably pulled the story from two dozens sites. After Charging That Israel Launched War, Reuters ‘Adds Context’ of Hamas’ Oct. 7 Invasion Reuters ""adds context"" about Hamas' massive Oct. 7 attacks to a Facebook post which cites ""the war Israel launched against Hamas."" While the inclusion of Hamas' Oct. 7 atrocities is certainly a significant improvement, it should be noted that Israel didn’t “launch” a war, Hamas did. CAMERA Op-Ed: Hamas Uses Hospitals and the Washington Post Hamas is using hospitals for cover. And the media is covering for Hamas. Worse still, as CAMERA tells the Washington Times, a contributor for the Washington Post even cheered on the October 7th massacre. Reuters Clarifies: Israel Wasn’t Alone in Blaming Iran For Bombing of Argentine Jewish Center CAMERA prompts corrections in both English and Arabic after Reuters misleadingly reported that Israel alone blames Iran for the 1994 bombing of the Buenos Aires Jewish center in which 85 were murdered. The United States and Argentina also blame Iran. AFP Corrects: Abraham Accords Didn’t Permit Israel Annexation of West Bank Land CAMERA prompts correction of an English-language AFP article which falsely reported that the Abraham Accords permitted Israeli annexation of West Bank land. In fact, the accords achieved normalization between Israel and Arab states and removed annexation from the agenda. CAMERA Op-Ed: What the Damascus Strike Tells Us Israel allegedly struck a building next to a consulate in Damascus. The strike took out top operatives from Iran's IRGC. And as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the strike tells us much about the current state of play in the Middle East. CAMERA Op-Ed: CAMERA Highlights Evacuation of Israeli Civilians Thousands of Israeli civilians have been evacuated since Hamas and other Iranian proxies initiated a genocidal war against the Jewish state. As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the current situation is unsustainable and, to the north, a potential war with fellow proxy Hezbollah looms. The Rape Deniers Where there are anti-Jewish atrocities, there are deniers. And on Oct 7, there were atrocities. Countless acts of murder and mutilation — and brutal acts of sexual violence by the Palestinian attackers. Cue the deniers and their manipulations. CAMERA Letter in the Washington Times: US Action at UN Breaks Tradition A recent decision by the US to abstain on a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire is a break with tradition. As CAMERA tells the Washington Times: there was a ceasefire, and Hamas broke it. ‘Lebanese Sunni Muslim Group’: AP Captions Extend PR First Aid To Jema’a Islamiya Terrorists Associated Press photo captions depict a south Lebanese site hit in an Israeli airstrike as nothing more than a civilian paramedical center, concealing that Jema'a Islamiya is a designated terror group. CAMERA Op-Ed: Gaza, the Day After Militarily, Israel's war against Hamas and other Gaza-based proxies is going well. Indeed, the IDF has made remarkable gains. But diplomatically and politically, the post-war phase will present Israel with numerous challenges, as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner. CAMERA Op-Ed: The UN Vote to Save Hamas Efforts are underway to save Hamas. Unsurprisingly, such efforts include the UN. Sadly, a recent US decision at the United Nations does more harm than good. Buckle Up: NPR Takes Listeners For A Ride 30,000 Trucks Long Truckers are accustomed to very long journeys, but what about a line of 30,000 vehicles waiting for months on end to pass inspections and cross a border? If that sounds like beyond the realm of reason, it's because it is. Introducing Jane Arraf's tall tale of the wide loads. UPI Lies About U.N. Data, Promotes Blood Libel That Jewish Settlers Killed Nearly 200 UPI's Adam Schrader falsely reports that according to UN data, Israeli settlers are responsible for most of the 199 Palestinians killed in the West Bank from Jan. 1 to Oct. 6 of last year. In fact, UN data shows seven Palestinians were killed in incidents involving settlers. In virtually all of the cases, the Palestinian fatalities were perpetrators attacking Israelis. AP Loses Way in Shifa Tunnels: Drops U.S. Intelligence Findings Confirming Hamas Command Center Where is AP's vaunted transparency when it comes to the independent U.S. intelligence about the Hamas command center? Like a Hamas weapons cache hidden away in Shifa's MRI ward, deliberate and deceptive concealment ironically finds a home in a place of supposedly total transparency. CAMERA Education Institute Statement on Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) Webinar The Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) union has once again engaged in the demonization and delegitimization of Israel with its recent webinar. Politico Punch-Card Cartoon Absurdly Suggests Israel Gets a “Free Pass” The cartoon doesn’t go as far as Holocaust inversion, but it is related to that phenomenon in that it uses the Holocaust “as a stick to beat” Israel. True and False Media Coverage of the Gaza War Media coverage of the Gaza war has too much in common with the tactics of a dishonest used car salesman. What's being sold? AP Casts Bigoted Demand That American Jew Remove Kippa As Saudi ‘Sensitivity’ Falling into an antisemitic trope, AP fails to amend after whitewashing the Saudi anti-Jewish bigotry hurled at American Rabbi Abraham Cooper, chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, as ""sensitivity"" due to Israel's war against Hamas. October Rockets: Reuters Makes Hezbollah Attacks A Thing of the Past Reuters misleadingly reported March 13 that ""Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel in October in support of Hamas,"" as if the terror organization's incessant attacks hadn't continued up until that very same morning. The Media Aids Hamas Israel has been assailed for not getting aid to Gazans. Policymakers have picked up on this narrative, pushed by the mainstream press. But as CAMERA notes, it is deeply misleading. Camera prompts correction on Gaza casualties from Daily Mail The British outlet erroneously characterized all casualties as ""civilians."" At last count, there are 13,000 dead Hamas combatants. ‘The Latest’? AP’s Fealty Vs. Footdragging Reporting Fatality Stats from Hamas, Israel Nearly every day, AP religiously recounts with muezzin-like regularity Hamas' latest figures for Palestinian casaulties. Meanwhile, the news agency delays and discredits when it comes to IDF-supplied data on Hamas fatalities. Sometimes updates happen only after CAMERA's nudging, resulting in underreporting of Hamas fatalities. CAMERA Op-Ed: Hezbollah’s Control of Lebanon The press has failed to fully note the extent to which Hezbollah controls Lebanon. Indeed, as CAMERA tells Providence Magazine, the Lebanese Armed Forces have been caught cooperating with the terror group. This bodes poorly for the next Israel-Hezbollah War. 20 McClatchy Sites Delete False Story About NJ Synagogue ‘Sale’ of ‘Palestinian Land’ CAMERA prompts the removal of a false story by UPI's Adam Schrader from more than 20 McClatchy news sites two days after UPI itself had commendably corrected the fallacious report that a New Jersey synagogue was selling 'Palestinian land' against the backdrop of so-called 'genocide.' Dissecting CNN’s Allegation of an Atrocity by Israel If CNN can’t be relied upon to produce an accurate picture of the facts, or to give the proper analysis of those facts, then can CNN be relied upon as a serious journalistic entity at all? CAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Uses Palestinian Babies as Anti-Israel Props, Again There they go again. The Washington Post can't quit using Palestinian babies as props in their propaganda war against Israel. A recent Post news story blaming Israel for dangers faced by Palestinian babies leaving Gaza didn't even mention Hamas. CAMERA Op-Ed: Linking Israel’s 2014 War Against Hamas to Today CAMERA reviews a new memoir by Ari Harow, Netanyahu's former chief of staff, for the Washington Free Beacon and finds that Israel's war against Hamas in the summer of 2014 foreshadowed tactics that the terrorist group would employ in its war on the Jewish state in 2023-24. CBS’ Imtiaz Tyab Reports As Fact Disputed Hamas Claims on Aid Distribution Deaths Imtiaz Tyab repeatedly treats unverified, disputed allegations from the designated terror organziation at face value, stating as fact that Israeli gunfire killed 115 Palestinians collecting food aid. Foreign Affairs Gets Lost in the Middle East Foreign Affairs magazine has an illustrious history. For more than a century, the publication has published groundbreaking essays that have define foreign policy debates in both Washington and the world. But the magazine's recent Middle East coverage is replete with omissions and anti-Israel bias. CAMERA Op-Ed: Israel Helps America’s Defense Industrial Base Israel, CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, is key to America's defense industrial base, creating jobs for Americans. But a recent move to reshore munitions manufacturing can also benefit the United States. At NY Times, Subtle Skew Hides Amid the Big Blunders You know of the flagrant falsehoods. But day in and day out, subtle messages further skew New York Times coverage. NPR’s Jane Arraf Blames ‘Israeli Attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque’ For Iraqi Militia Violence In an article that is part of NPR's ""Middle East crisis — explained"" special series, Jane Arraf cites non-existing ""Israeli attacks on the Al-Aqsa mosque"" as fueling Iraqi militia violence targeting U.S. troops. LA Times Refuses To Substantiate, Retract Toxic Charge that IDF Snipers Targeted Kids That The Los Angeles Times cannot or will not substantiate a toxic charge redolent of an age-old bigoted trope demonizing Jews as child killers is particularly troubling in this period of unprecedented antisemitism. CNN Reporting: Conflicts of Interest, A Missing Terrorist Organization, And an Inability to Verify First, the article spills large amounts of ink to link Israel to tragedies, while omitting or glossing over the existence and responsibility of other parties. Second, the article employs a curious double standard as to informing readers of when the network was “unable to verify” details being reported. Third, the background of one of the journalists himself raises questions of a conflict of interest. Reinstated US Position on Settlements Revives Long-Standing Misreporting on Decades-Old Policy While the Biden Administration's decision to consider settlements illegal under international law in no way restores a decades-long U.S. policy, media reports that it does just that do revive long-standing miscoverage of U.S. policy. Tracing the Dubious Allegations of Sexual Violence Made Against Israeli Forces The only source for the allegations of sexual violence by Israeli forces that several United Nations ""experts"" were willing to point to was a public report by an organization called Women's Centre for Legal Aid and Counseling (WCLAC). Given that this is all the public has to go on to scrutinize the allegations, it is worth examining WCLAC’s report. Once Again, CNN Gives an Antisemite a Propaganda Platform CNN bewilderingly decided to amplify an antisemite’s horrific allegations against the Jewish state, notwithstanding they lacked any supporting evidence, and without mentioning her extraordinary bias on the subject. At UPI, Hang Glider Journalist Adam Schrader Shills For Hamas Couch journalist Adam Schrader branches into a new speciality: hang glider journalism, or shilling for Hamas post-Oct. 7, 2023. Swooping in with great conviction and few facts, the international breaking news editor whitewashes and justifies Hamas' heinous atrocities. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Covers for UNRWA, Again Compelling evidence has emerged indicating that UNRWA employees took part in the October 7 massacre. As CAMERA tells the Algemeiner, this is part of a long-standing pattern at the UN agency. The Washington Post, however, ignores the long history, and sordid mission, of UNRWA. Another CNN Report on Gaza Based on Little Evidence, No Context, But Lots of Insinuation As CAMERA has repeatedly documented, there is a pattern of CNN reports lobbing horrific allegations at Israel based on exceedingly thin evidence and lots of insinuation. It’s a standard, or practice, akin to tabloid journalism – a standard certainly not appropriate for serious journalism or serious accusations like that of war crimes. NY Times Entombs Criticism of UNRWA Buried 18 meters under a United Nations headquarters in the Gaza Strip is a Hamas tunnel and data center, Israeli army engineers announced on Saturday. That’s also how deep, in paragraphs, the New York Times buried news of the discovery. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Isn’t Sure Hamas Engaged in Mass Rape It is a well documented fact that Hamas committed acts of sexual violence on October 7. But in the latest example of its fall from journalistic grace, the Washington Post raises doubts that such evil acts occurred. As CAMERA tells JNS, this is to the Post's eternal shame. CBS Falsely Reports U.S. Warned Israel Not To Attack Rafah CBS's Deborah Patta falsely reported that Netanyahu ""stubbornly refuses to listen"" to his American interlocutors. But the Israeli Prime Minister's order to devise an evacuation plan for Rafah's civilians means that he listened very attentively. The U.S. exhorted Israel to prepare a solid plan to protect Rafah's civilians before carrying out a military operation. The Biden administration did not tell Israel not to attack Rafah. The State of Palestinians: AP Errs on Oslo Accords, Strips Palestinians Of Agency AP's Julia Frankel falsely reports that under the intermin peace deals, ""the self-rule government was meant to expand and eventually run a future Palestinian state."" In Frankel's telling, the still stateless Palestinians have no responsibility for their current state of affairs, including West Bank economic hardship born of Hamas' Oct. 7 atrocities. Reuters Reporting Goes South, Falsely Claims Israel Ordered Palestinians in Rafah to Evacuate Southward UPDATE: Reuters corrects a video which falsely reported that Israel has ordered the evacuation of over one million Palestinians in Rafah southward. Any evacuation of Palestinians in Rafah further south would mean evacuation into Egypt, and Israel has absolutely not ordered the evacuation of Palestinians onto Egyptian territory. CAMERA Op-Ed: UNRWA’s Problematic History On October 7, UN employees helped perpetrate the largest massacre of Jewish civilians since the Holocaust. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Times this revelation is as unsurprising as it is infuriating. UNRWA is part of the problem, not the solution. CAMERA Op-Ed: Does UNRWA Deserve a Role in Rebuilding Gaza? Employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency took part in the October 7 massacre. This revelation came the day after the U.S. State Department suggested that UNRWA should play a role in rebuilding Gaza. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner UNRWA should be persona non grata. NPR Covers Up U.S. Intelligence on Hamas Command Center at Shifa Hospital National Public Radio, whose founding mission is ""to create a more informed public,"" for months has kept from its 44 million weekly listeners the U.S. intelligence assessment that Hamas did indeed operate a command center in Gaza City's Shifa Hospital. Khaled Gharabli’s Apparent Departure Is A Step in the Right Direction For France24 Arabic Khaled Gharabli, the international affairs analyst notorious for routinely misplacing all semblance of impartiality and accuracy when it comes to Israel, has been notably absent from the French public broadcaster for the last two months, It is still early, though, to talk about a true wind of change at France 24’s Arabic service. AFP Corrects On 1948 Palestinian Refugees CAMERA prompts correction of an English-language AFP article which erroneously reported that all of the Palestinian refugees from 1948 were forcibly displaced from their homes. In fact, the vast majority fled, often at the urging of their own leaders. The Hill Declining: Rising’s Jessica Burbank & The Peace-Loving Houthis According to Jessica Burbank, the Houthis are peace activists targeting ships bringing weapons to Israel, some 23 percent of Gaza's young women have been sexually assaulted by IDF soldiers, Hamas doesn't operate in the West Bank and US intelligence agencies are wrong about Hamas' command center in Shifa hospital. CAMERA’s Impact Upsets The Intercept It's one part defense of Hamas, one part rant against CAMERA, and one part insinuation that an editor’s late father pulls the New York Times strings from beyond the grave. But thank you, The Intercept, for recognizing our successes. Tabloid Journalism at CNN: “Palestinians are eating grass” To make such an eye-popping claim in the headline based solely on one man’s hearsay is irresponsible journalism. It comes across as either clickbait or an effort to advance a partisan narrative. CAMERA Letter in the Washington Times: Iran is Driving Instability The Islamic Republic of Iran is driving instability in the Middle East. As CAMERA tells the Washington Times, the Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and seeks to remake the Middle East. CNN Errs on UNRWA’s Refugee Definition, Downplays Scandals Given CNN’s fondness for investigations, one is left to wonder: why isn’t CNN devoting any substantial effort to holding UNRWA to account by asking the hard questions of the agency? MSNBC: Four Months of Disinformation Common distortions include omitting the 2005 disengagement from Gaza and the subsequent election of a group sworn to Israel's destruction to power in the territory, promoting anti-Israel propagandists, and ignoring the numbers of casualties that are reported to be Hamas fighters. In addition, at least two commentators called on the US to force Israel essentially to surrender. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Gives a Pass to Antisemitic Institutions The Washington Post is failing to shine a light on institutions that are propagating antisemitism, a virus that has resulted in the murder of millions in living memory. The newspaper is failing to provide adequate coverage of the ICRC and UNRWA, CAMERA tells the Algemeiner. Haaretz Clarifies: Gunmen Who Killed East Jerusalem Arabs Were Palestinians Haaretz's English edition amends an article which had failed to identify Palestinian gunmen as responsible for the fatal West Bank shootings of east Jerusalem Arabs, leaving readers to wrongly assume that Israeli settlers were the culprits. Media Outlets Correct Yoav Gallant Misquote on Eliminating Hamas Following last week's New York Times correction of Megan Stack's Op-Ed falsely quoting Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant calling for the annihilation of the Gaza Strip, CAMERA has prompted additional corrections at NPR, Salt Lake Tribune and The Telegraph (London). Brown University’s Middle East Studies Faculty: Profiles in Extremist Anti-Israel Bias A non-exhaustive list of anti-Israel and antisemitic public rhetoric from many of the faculty members at Brown University's Center for Middle East Studies. The rhetoric shown helps demonstrate the level of bias and hostility toward the Jewish state. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Parrots Hamas The Washington Post has a favorite source: Hamas. As CAMERA tells JNS, the newspaper is determined to parrot the terrorist group's propaganda. New York Times Erases Hostages From Soccer Player’s Gesture, Calls It a War Message On January 14, communities across the globe marked 100 days since Israeli hostages were abducted to Gaza. When an Israeli soccer player in Turkey was arrested for doing the same, the New York Times cast it as a martial reference, and refused to correct their misrepresentation. NBC Report on Escalating West Bank Violence Conceals Palestinian Violence NBC's Richard Engel conceals that slain teen Taha Mahmeed was a Hamas member who was engaged in clashes with Israeli troops and neglects to report the existence of an explosives lab and weapons cache. Bloomberg Deletes Incendiary ‘Israel Genocide’ Headline In response to communication from CAMERA, Bloomberg commendably moves swiftly to remove an incendiary News Now podcast headline referring to ""Israel Genocide."" Lawfare Blog Won’t Correct Garlasco’s Gaza Errors Although Lawfare’s Editor in Chief Benjamin Wittes and Managing Editor Tyler McBrien were informed of errors and distortions in a piece by Marc Garlasco, they remain uncorrected. Snip, Snip: AP Cleans Up Slain Hamas Member Osaid Rimawi AP runs more than 1200 words on the Israeli military's allegedly unprovoked fatal shooting of Osaid Rimawi, ""a high school student studying to become a barber,"" never once mentioning that he was a Hamas member. CNN’s Investigations: Biased Expert Analysis Expert analysis, when used properly, can help audiences contextualize factual reporting. But when used improperly, it can mislead audiences by exaggerating or downplaying certain details to fit into a preconceived narrative. Repeatedly, CNN’s investigations have fallen into the latter category by portraying demonstrably biased “experts” as neutral sources. CAMERA Op-Ed: The Messages Behind Israel’s Beirut Strike An Israeli strike in Beirut took out top Hamas operatives, including Saleh Al-Arouri. CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner that the strike is about more than eliminating a top Hamas commander, it is also about sending a message to terrorists: those responsible for October 7th will be held accountable. Haaretz Corrects False Report Claiming Netanyahu Weighing Deportation of Gaza Residents Haaretz amends after falsely reporting that Netanyahu's statements about the possibility of deporting Hamas leadership applied to Gaza residents, a fallacious claim which provided tailwind to South Africa's unfounded genocide charge. CNN’s Investigations: Glossing Over Questions of Credibility A consistent concern with CNN investigations is their habit of misleading the audience about the reliability of the evidence presented. The Washington Post Reprints Antisemitic Blood Libel A Hamas press release has accused Israel of harvesting the organs of dead Palestinians. A Washington Post reprint of the Hamas statement tells readers that ‘the claims could not be independently verified.’ CNN’s Investigations: Omitting Exculpatory Information Good investigative journalism is journalism at its best. Unfortunately, that kind of good journalism is rare at CNN. Rather than producing impartial, professional investigations, many of the network’s journalists are acting as one-sided prosecutors when it comes to Israel. AFP Posthumously Demotes Hamas Commanders to Bodyguards AFP improves coverage after initially demoting terror commanders killed alongside Salah Al-Arouri to ""bodyguards"" and omitting the Hamas deputy's second claim to infamy: founding the terror organization's military wing. Reuters’ Rough Reporting on Gaza Aid, Philadelphi Route, ‘Palestine’ Statehood Reuters closes the curtain on 2023 with rough reporting on aid to the Gaza Strip, the implications of Israeli control over the narrow Philadelphi corridor border area, and ""Palestine"" statehood. CAMERA’s 2023 Highlights: A Year of Impact and Advocacy Discover the remarkable achievements of CAMERA in 2023, from setting records in global media corrections to spearheading influential campaigns and educational initiatives. More Hamas Advocacy on PBS NewsHour As a recipient of federal funding, PBS must comply with the federal statute requiring strict adherence to objectivity and balance in programs of a controversial nature. Yet PBS Newshour continues to present one-sided segments with guests who shill for Hamas. How the AP (and WaPo and NY Times) Lie with Statistics With the Associated Press claim that Israel's war against Hamas “now sits among the deadliest and most destructive in history,” the wire service joins a parade of statistical inventions and manipulations. CNN Weekend Roundup, 12/22-12/25: Misinformation for Christmas Christmas is a time for religious and family traditions. At CNN this weekend, the traditions included appropriating Jesus to besmirch the Jewish state and erasing the existence of Palestinian violence and Israeli victims. Hillary Clinton Sets the Israel-Gaza Record Straight on The View Appearing on The View, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton debunks the anti-Israel narrative that has become commonplace in much of the media and a sizeable portion of the population in the US and Europe, often citing what she personally witnessed in office. NPR Complicit in UNRWA Underreporting of Aid Trucks Now that Israel has opened the Kerem Shalom crossing, UNRWA's Phillippe Lazzarini underreports the amount of aid passing through and ignores a new route for Jordanian aid. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly collegially plays along, repeatedly ""correcting"" President Herzog. Vice Arabia: Hamas’ Oct. 7 Massacre Legitimate Under International Law A Vice Arabia ""explainer"" by Badar Salem falsely legitimizes Hamas' Oct. 7 atrocities as legal under international law. Vice defends the fallacious and dangerous ""explainer"" as ""opinion,"" though it's not labeled as such. CAMERA’s Alex Safian appears on Mark Levin’s Life, Liberty and Levin CAMERA’s Alex Safian joined Mark Levin on his top-rated FoxNews program Life, Liberty and Levin to discuss the abysmal media coverage of Israel’s war against Hamas, which was triggered by the terrorist organization’s horrific massacre of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7. CAMERA Report: Brown University’s Choices Curriculum is a Platform for Anti-Zionist Narrative CAMERA has just published its investigation of the Choices Program's curriculum pertaining to Zionism, Israel and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Replete with historical revisionism and anti-Zionist tropes ,it whitewashes Palestinian aggression and terrorism, erases Hamas’ stated goals and genocidal intent and portrays the existence of the Jewish state as illegitimate. Such a curriculum can only fuel the growing antisemitism in U.S. classrooms. Jewish Students Were Besieged. The NY Times Casts the Besiegers as Victims. Two months anti-Israel protesters intimidated Jews in the Cooper Union library, the New York Times again reported on the disturbance — this time, to recast the agitators who caused Jews to fear for their safety as the situation’s real victims. CAMERA Op-Ed: Harvard excludes rather than includes the Jews Despite hiring so many presumably brilliant minds and sinking millions into addressing the issue of diversity, equity and inclusion, the best answer to antisemitism the university could come up with was “hide the Jews.” A CNN Article Tries to Explain Away Palestinian Support for Hamas’s Atrocities Two CNN reporters spin the disturbing results showing widespread Palestinian support for the October 7 attack by Palestinian terrorist organizations by suggesting support for the attack doesn’t actually mean they support the atrocities that characterized the attack. This isn't journalism. This is damage control. Hamas Propaganda by Doctors Without Borders, Courtesy of PBS Newshour PBS is peddling Hamas propaganda via representatives from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known by its English translation, “Doctors Without Borders.” Representatives are accusing Israel of war crimes and demanding a ceasefire while denying Hamas' role in the war. CAMERA Challenges Washington Post’s Pro-Hamas Bias with Mobile Billboard Campaign CAMERA initiated the mobile campaign due to concerns about the Washington Post’s reliance on Hamas-provided casualty figures, notably those from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. New York Times Reporters Act as Hamas Stenographers, Forget to Omit ‘Israeli Occupation Forces’ The deletion of the telling ""occupation forces"" slip-up can't conceal the writers' devotion to serving as obedient Hamas mouthpieces. When it comes to Hamas talking points, buzzing flies prove dead bodies. But when it comes to Israeli claims, even weapons can't prove weapons. To See Or Not To See: AFP and Hezbollah’s ‘Visible Presence’ On Israel’s Border AFP bizarrely reports that Hezbollah ""says it has no visible border presence in the border region"" north of Israel, even as the terror group openly claims credits for attacks that it launched from that area. CNN Weekend Review, 12/15-12/17: Is Reality Just an Israeli Allegation? Over the weekend, there was much to desire when it came to CNN’s online coverage of the Israel-Hamas War. Reality was downgraded to just an “Israeli claim.” Terror tunnels were upgraded to a McDonald’s drive-through. Meanwhile, important stories that provide crucial context for those seeking to understand events continue to be omitted. Doppelganger: Real AP News Report on Black Americans, Palestinians Mimics Fake News AP's effort to pass off the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as the Middle Eastern doppelgänger of the civil rights movement, with the Palestinians playing the part of Black Americans battling against racism, is nothing short of a parody of journalism. Reuters’ Error, Double Standard and Omissions Reuters' recent misreporting includes a factual error (no, Houthi attacks did not hit Eilat), an egregious double standard on casualty reporting, and whitewashing Palestinian combatants plus Hamas' brutal takeover. Cynthia Nixon Pushes False Claims and Holocaust Inversion on The View None of Nixon's hosts pushed back on her false claim about Gaza casualties, or on her weaponization of her relatives' experience as Holocaust survivors against the Jewish state. The Washington Post Covers for CAIR, Again The executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations hailed the October 7th massacre of civilians by Hamas, prompting a rebuke from the White House. Yet the Washington Post, which frequently quotes the faux civil rights organization, failed to note either the rebuke or CAIR's praise for Hamas. CAMERA Report: Anti-Israel Extremism and Corrupt Scholarship at Brown University Spurred on by the concerns of Brown University alumni and students, CAMERA decided to investigate antisemitism and extremism at Brown University. What we found is truly disturbing. Following Contact from CAMERA, Washington Post Corrects on Disproportionate Bombing Claim The Washington Post belatedly corrects on an inaccurate claim meant to make the IDF's bombing campaign in Gaza look disproportionate. It turns out that relying on a collector of Nazi memorabilia, whose history of anti-Israel bias is a matter of public record, was a poor decision. CAMERA Op-Ed: Anti-Israel Crybullies and the Free Speech Inversion As defined at Dictionary.com, a crybully is “a person who self-righteously harasses or intimidates others while playing the victim, especially of a perceived social injustice.” It’s a particularly accurate label for the crowd of anti-Israel activists who have spent decades working to silence and intimidate Jewish and Israeli voices on campuses while also portraying themselves as victims of an attack on their free speech.

Which raises the question: Why does the New York Times choose to prevaricate on the subject? CNN Stood by a False Claim. CAMERA Has the Proof. CAMERA promptly alerted the network to a significant error in an video report about released Palestinian prisoners. Instead of a correction, the day after CAMERA’s communication, the network went on to publish a written version of the report, prominently featuring the same exact error in the first two sentences. CAMERA has now acquired and provided the network with conclusive evidence that the claim is false. John Oliver on danger that Hamas will repeat 10/7 Attack: Oh well!

She said that later in life, insurance wouldn't cover it because it would be a pre-existing condition. The father was an ex-boyfriend who was in another relationship. I think my parents were concerned about my future because the guy was usually out of work and lived off of the girls he went out with. I regret the decision to have an abortion.

wcbm.com,right,WCBM News-Talk Radio,"David Childs, the lead architect of the One World Trade Center skyscraper that rose from the site where the Twin Towers collapsed in New York City during the 9/11 attacks, has died. He was 83. Childs died on Wednesday in Pelham, New York, from Lewy body dementia, which had been diagnosed in September, his son, Nicholas Childs said. While he was perhaps best known for his work on One World Trade Center, considered to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, Childs also was instrumental in other important projects, including a new master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C., an expansion of Dulles International Airport in Virginia and the 7 World Trade Center building in Manhattan, according to his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. “David’s contribution to the firm was extensive and profound, and we will always be grateful to David for his leadership, his impact, and his friendship,” Skidmore, Owings & Merrill said in a statement. “We will miss him dearly and extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to his family.” A fond memory that Nicholas Childs has was when his father drew a rendering of what the One World Trade Center property would look like while they were out having lunch in New York, some years after 9/11 but well before the plans were finalized. “He picked up a paper napkin, took out a pen, and drew what became the ultimate design of the building on the napkin for me,” Nicholas Childs said in a phone interview Friday, adding that he still has the drawing. He said his father was a civic-minded architect who would often use a quote by 20th century American-German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe — “God is in the details.” “He cared deeply about those details and making something beautiful,” Nicholas Childs said. “But he also wanted to make sure, I think as any great architect, that it was a balance of form and function, that it worked for people.” The 1,776-foot-tall (540-meter-tall) One World Trade Center, once known as the Freedom Tower, is the centerpiece of the redevelopment of ground zero, along with the memorial pools placed where the Twin Towers stood. Opened in 2014, it sports a steel and glass structure that rises into the sky with a tapered, eight-triangle body, topped by a 408-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) needle. The final design was produced after contentious negotiations between Childs and Daniel Libeskind, who designed the overall plan for the site, and arguments between government officials over what should be built at ground zero and objections by some relatives of 9/11 victims to the design of the Trade Center memorial. Libeskind had drawn the first plans for building, a twisting glass skyscraper with an off-center spire meant to invoke the Statue of Liberty. Childs produced a sleeker version of Libeskind’s design, then reworked it after police expressed concerns that the building was not sturdy enough to withstand a truck bomb. In announcing the new design plans, Childs said the One World Trade Center tower is “iconic, simple and pure in its form, a memorable form that will reclaim the resilience and the spirit of our democracy.” He also called it “the safest building in the world,” with features including wider staircases, a separate stairway and elevator for firefighters, “blast-resistant glazing” and more public stairways with direct access to the street. Childs was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1941 and grew up in his early childhood years in Washington, D.C., before moving to Mount Kisco, New York. He attended the private Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, before going to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in architecture. He was hired by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1971 for its Washington, D.C., office, where he worked on projects including a new master plan for the National Mall, the Constitution Gardens park along the mall and the Four Seasons Hotel. He transferred to the firm’s New York City office in 1984 and had a hand in significant projects in the city, including 1 Worldwide Plaza in the Hell’s Kitchen section of Manhattan and the Deutsche Bank Center, formerly called the Time Warner Center, with its twin skyscraper towers at Columbus Circle. Childs also worked on the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, Canada, the Canary Wharf development in London and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In 2004, he was honored with a Rome Prize for architecture, awarded by the American Academy in Rome for innovative work in the arts and humanities. Childs is survived by his wife, Annie; three children, Nicholas, Joshua and Jocelyn; and several grandchildren. The family is planning a small, private memorial in the coming weeks, followed by a larger service around May, Nicholas Childs said.

For those in the UK looking for secure and regulated platforms, exploring online casinos uk is a good starting point. Some well-known gaming authorities include the Malta Gaming Authority, UK Gambling Commission, and the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority.

A good online casino should have a wide selection of games, including slots, table games, live dealer games, and more. For those in the UK looking for diverse gaming experiences, exploring a range of gambling sites uk is essential. The more diverse the game library, the more options you have to find games that suit your preferences.

Bonuses and Promotions Most online casinos offer attractive bonuses and promotions to entice new players and reward loyal customers. Look for online casinos that provide generous welcome bonuses, free spins, cashback offers, and ongoing promotions. However, be sure to read the terms and conditions associated with these bonuses, including wagering requirements and withdrawal limits. Customer Support A reliable online casino should have a responsive and helpful customer support team. Make sure the casino offers multiple support options such as live chat, email, and phone support. Additionally, check if the casino has a comprehensive FAQ section that provides answers to common queries.

Tips and Strategies for Winning at Online Casinos While casino games are largely based on luck, there are several tips and strategies that can help increase your chances of winning. Here are some essential tips to keep in mind while playing at online casinos: 1. Bankroll Management Effective bankroll management is crucial for long-term success in online gambling. Set a budget for your gambling activities and stick to it. Only wager money that you can afford to lose, and avoid chasing losses by increasing your bets. Divide your bankroll into smaller sessions to ensure you can enjoy playing for a longer duration. 2. Game Selection Choose games that you are familiar with and enjoy playing. By understanding the rules and strategies of a game, you can make better decisions and increase your chances of winning. Experiment with different games to find the ones that suit your style of play and provide the most entertainment. 3. Understanding the Odds Every casino game has its odds and probabilities. Familiarize yourself with the odds of the games you play and choose those with favorable odds. For example, blackjack has one of the lowest house edges among casino games, giving players a better chance of winning. 4. Using Bonuses effectively Take advantage of the bonuses and promotions offered by online casinos. These can boost your bankroll and provide additional opportunities to win. However, make sure to read and understand the terms and conditions associated with the bonuses, including wagering requirements. 5. Knowing When to Quit Gambling should always be viewed as entertainment, and it is essential to know when to walk away. Set limits for yourself, both in terms of time and money, and stick to them. Avoid chasing losses and resist the temptation to keep playing in the hopes of recovering your losses. Responsible Gambling and Player Protection While online gambling can be an enjoyable activity, it is important to practice responsible gambling and take steps to protect yourself. Here are some key measures to ensure your safety while playing at online casinos: 1. Setting Limits Set personal limits on the amount of time and money you spend gambling. Online casinos often provide tools that allow you to set deposit limits, session limits, and loss limits. Use these features to control your gambling activities and prevent excessive spending. 2. Self-Exclusion If you feel your gambling habits are becoming problematic, many online casinos offer self-exclusion options. Self-exclusion allows you to take a break from gambling for a predetermined period or even permanently. During this time, you will be unable to access your casino account, ensuring you have a chance to take a step back and seek help if needed. 3. Problem Gambling Organizations Several organizations worldwide specialize in assisting problem gamblers. Look for resources provided by organizations such as Gamblers Anonymous, National Council on Problem Gambling, or GamCare. These organizations can provide helpful information, support, and guidance to individuals struggling with gambling-related issues. 4. Player Verification and Security Measures Reputable online casinos ensure the security and protection of their players by implementing robust verification processes. These processes often include age verification to prevent underage gambling and identity verification to combat fraud and money laundering. Make sure the online casino you choose follows these strict security measures to provide a safe and secure gambling environment. Conclusion Online casinos offer a convenient and exciting way to enjoy real money casino games from the comfort of your home. By selecting a reputable online casino, exploring popular games, using effective strategies, and practicing responsible gambling, you can enhance your gaming experience and increase your chances of winning. Remember to always set limits, know when to quit, and prioritize fun and entertainment while playing at online casinos.

wcbm.com,right,WCBM News-Talk Radio,"NEW YORK (AP) — Even if you’re not in the market for a new car, U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on auto imports could make owning one more expensive. The new taxes, which are set to begin April 3 and expand in the following weeks, are estimated to raise the average cost of a car imported from another country by thousands of dollars. But repairs for vehicles that currently use foreign-made parts are also expected to get pricier — and, as a result, hike insurance costs farther down the road. While the White House says these tariffs will foster domestic manufacturing and raise $100 billion in revenue annually, economists stress that straining the auto industry’s global supply chain brings significant disruptions. Dealerships and car repair shops will likely have little choice but to raise prices — leading drivers across the country to pay more for everyday maintenance. Here’s what you need to know. It depends on what you need fixed and where you go in to get your car serviced. But some industry analysts warn that drivers could see costs jump in as early as the coming weeks or months. “If you are bringing your car to get repaired, chances are, it’s going to have a part that comes from another country,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying resource Edmunds. “That price that you pay is likely going to be directly affected by the increase (from these tariffs).” Trump’s Wednesday proclamation on auto tariffs points specifically to engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components. That covers a lot of repairs as is, Caldwell notes, and the administration has also signaled the possibility of future expansion. And while automakers may develop new pricing strategies for new vehicles impacted by tariffs, Caldwell expects they will to be less likely to absorb the costs of individual parts — leaving consumers with the bill perhaps more imminently. Much of the car repair market has heavily relied on imports, particularly from America’s biggest trading partners. According to February numbers from the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, a trade group that represents home, auto and business insurers, about 6 in every 10 auto replacements parts used in U.S. auto shop repairs are imported from Mexico, Canada and China. “You can’t walk into a dealership today and not see a United Nations of parts,” said Skyler Chadwick, director of Product Consulting at Cox Automotive. But sourcing and supply varies between each servicer, he adds, making it all the more complex to nail down when exactly prices will rise after these tariffs take effect. Desiree Hill, owner of Crown’s Corner, an auto repair and mechanics shop in Conyers, Georgia, says the auto tariffs were already hurting her business. She was working on repairing a vintage 1960 Opel Rekord car and ordered a part from Germany, but the manufacturer canceled the order due to the tariffs. “I can’t get (the part) anywhere in our country. Period. So that that was very disappointing,” she said. About half of the cars she works on are foreign-made, so the tariffs will make repairing those cars more difficult. “Unfortunately we don’t have a choice but to raise prices if they are raised on us,” she said. “We can’t take that kind of loss.” Car repair prices have already been on the rise for years, with analysts pointing both to growing labor costs and more expensive components needed for vehicles with advanced technology. Edward Salamy, executive director of the Automotive Body Parts Association, also says car companies have been trying to “gain a monopoly” to limit remedies to their own parts or processes, reducing options for consumers. Tariffs, he said, will just exacerbate the issue: “Many of these distributors will have no choice but to raise their list price.” Joshua Allrich, who operates a family-owned used car dealership called Allrich Auto in Atlanta, is among those concerned about facing higher costs while also trying to save his customers money. “It’s going to make things a lot more expensive,” Allirch said, adding that, while he’s looking forward to the possibility of people rushing to buy cars before the tariffs take effect, his business will soon have to adjust. “My wheelhouse is economy cars, affordable cars. And now, this tariff is going to directly hit us because it’s gonna just make things go up.” Chadwick says that dealers and other servicers will need to be as transparent as possible as these tariffs take effect while also preparing to have difficult conversations about rising prices with customers. He adds that tariffs are also going to put pressures on the reselling market. Used cars often have to be serviced before dealerships can sell them back to customers — again opening the door for higher repair costs due to tariffs. And “all that cost goes right back into the consumer” through what they end up having to pay for the vehicle, he explains. In efforts to delay impacts, some dealers and repair shops might turn to stocking up on inventory before tariffs hit, particularly for parts that get requested the most. Analysts say many have long-anticipated the threat of auto tariffs, and are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s new steel and aluminum levies that took effect earlier this month. But stockpiling can only go so far. And for small business owners, spending money for a lot of inventory at once can be risky, especially when Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff threats raise questions about how long they will last. If they end up being short-lived, Caldwell said, “Do you really want to buy a bunch of inventory that you’re going to have to sit and hold on (to) for quite some time?” Because accidents involving new parts will see increased costs for repairs, insurance premiums will also likely rise due to tariffs. But that may be farther into the future. Bob Passmore, department vice president of personal lines at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, expects consumers to see an impact on their insurance bill in 12 to 18 months at a minimum. That’s because increased prices have to hit claims costs, then be implemented after new rates are filed and approved. Still, the trade association has estimated that personal auto insurance claims costs alone could rise a total of between $7 billion and $24 billion annually. It wasn’t immediately clear how large providers of auto insurance were preparing for the impacts of these tariffs. Allstate, State Farm, Geico and Progressive did not immediately respond to The Associated Press’ requests for comment on Friday. But even if it takes long to trickle down, these tariff-related hikes would again arrive as consumers have already faced rising insurance costs. The Insurance Information Institute estimated that average U.S. auto premiums increased 14% in 2023 and 12% in 2024. Mark Friedlander, the institute’s senior director of media relations, said via email that the research trade nonprofit projected a 7% average premium increase for auto insurance across in 2025 at the start of the year — but that didn’t account for potential tariff impacts, which will drive them even higher. Increased costs spanning from tariffs cause a “chain reaction for insurance,” Caldwell adds. “This is a total ownership cost increase, rather than just a purchase increase.” ______ AP Business Writer Mae Anderson in New York and Video Journalist Sharon Johnson in Atlanta contributed to this report.

They are probably too impotent to derail the country, but they are certainly destroying themselves. Congress Has Mere Months to Address Debt Default, CBO Warns Daily Caller News Foundation (Adam Pack), The Star News Network The U.S. government has until August or September to lift the country’s borrowing limit to avert a default, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) projections. The nonpartisan forecast sets a deadline for Congress to address the statutory debt limit before the government runs out of money. Congressional Republicans are attempting to raise the debt limit through a filibuster-proof tax and spending package, circumventing Democratic lawmakers from potentially using debt limit negotiations as a point of leverage. MS-13’s East Coast leader nabbed in Virginia Maria Stainer and Matt Delaney, Washington Times U.S. authorities said the MS-13’s top leader on the East Coast was captured by federal agents in Northern Virginia.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi did not say what charges the suspect is facing as of now, but assured he is one of the Salvadoran gang’s top three leaders in the U.S. and had a hand in some of MS-13’s most violent crimes.
